      "The Zeros are an American punk rock band, formed in 1976 in Chula Vista, California. The band were originally composed of Javier Escovedo (younger brother of Alejandro Escovedo, older brother of Mario Escovedo of The Dragons) on vocals/guitar and Robert Lopez (later known as El Vez) on guitar, who were both attending Chula Vista High School; Hector Penalosa, (bass), and Baba Chenelle, (drums), who attended Sweetwater High School.  Sometimes compared to the Ramones, the band was considered a pioneer of punk rock on the West Coast.\n",
      "In 1977, The Zeros played their first major gig in Los Angeles at the Orpheum. Opening the show was the first performance by The Germs, followed by The Zeros and then The Weirdos. The gig was promoted by Peter Case of The Nerves, who later served as the frontman of The Breakaways and The Plimsouls. The Zeros' first single  release, \"Wimp\" b/w \"Don't Push Me Around\", was released in 1977 on Bomp! Records.\n",
      "In 1978, Penalosa left the band briefly to live and play in Los Angeles, and was replaced by Guy Lopez, Robert Lopez's brother. Soon after, Robert left to live in Los Angeles as well, and his brother quit the Zeros. Penalosa rejoined the band and they continued as a trio, and eventually relocated to San Francisco. In March 1979, UK music magazine NME reported that \"punk riots had come to the U.S., when Los Angeles police broke up a Zeros' gig at Elks Hall.\" In 1980, the band recorded a new single, including the songs \"They Say That (Everything's Alright),\" \"Girl on the Block\" and \"Getting Nowhere Fast.\" After more touring that led to Austin, Texas and New York, the band fizzled out.\n"
