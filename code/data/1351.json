      "Die Apokalyptischen Reiter (German for \"The Apocalyptic Riders\") is a Weimar, Germany based heavy metal band signed to Nuclear Blast in Europe and The End Records in North America.\n",
      "The band's original style, featured on their releases up to and including Allegro Barbaro and on a few songs on All You Need Is Love, consists of death/thrash metal blended with melodic compositions. In later albums, the death metal influence declined, resulting in less chaotic composition (often centered around a verse and chorus with a bridge and solo), more constant tempo, longer songs and clean vocals (although not exclusively). This resulted in a more polished and accessible sound. The band uses lyrics in both English and German with a shift from mainly English songs to more German ones on recent albums (Licht is entirely in German).\n",
      "The release of Have a Nice Trip marked somewhat of a turning point for the band. Although they retained the essence of heavy metal, they began experimenting with many other styles of music such as ambient and jazz.\n"
