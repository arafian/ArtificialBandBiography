      "Jack Off Jill was an American alternative rock band from Fort Lauderdale Florida founded in 1992 by vocalist Jessicka, drummer Tenni Ah-Cha-Cha, Agent Moulder, and guitarist Michelle Inhell. Though these four women were the initial founders,9 members rotated through the group in its life-span, including Scott Putesky, guitarist and co-founder of Marilyn Manson. The band lasted 3 years with only Jessicka remaining through all its line-ups. The band reunited in 2015 for a number of shows.\n",
      "Tenni Arslanyan met Jessicka while attending Piper High School in Sunrise, Florida. They had begun writing songs, but had not yet formed a band when Moulder and Inhell joined them to create the band that would become Jack Off Jill.\n",
      "Jack Off Jill's first show was opening for Marilyn Manson and his shock-rock outfit, Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids, at a Davie, Florida night club called The Plus Five Lounge. Manson went on to produce their early demos and had them open most of his shows.\n"
