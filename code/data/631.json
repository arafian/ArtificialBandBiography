      "The Capricorns were an  indie rock band consisting of Heather Lynn and Kirsten Nordine, both of whom sing and play keyboards, with Lynn also playing tambourine. They formed their band in the spring of 2000, playing on vintage Casio keyboards purchased at garage sales.  They write pop songs which one of their labels described as combining \"infectious hooks with 'dear diary' lyrics\".  They are originally from Grayslake, Illinois.\n",

      "Nordine and Lynn traveled to Cincinnati, Ohio to record their first album, The Capricorns Are Gonna Get You, a now-out of print cassette released on their own label.  Jason Barnett, of Paroxysm Records, heard the record, and offered them a record contract.\n"
