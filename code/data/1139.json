      "Black 'N Blue is an American heavy metal band from Portland, Oregon, United States. The current members are lead vocalist Jaime St. James, bassist Patrick Young, drummer Pete Holmes, and guitarists Brandon Cook and Bobby Capka. The band is best known for their song \"Hold On to 18\" from their eponymous debut studio album, Black 'n Blue, released in August 1984.\n",
      "Black 'N Blue was formed in November 1981 by high school friends Jamie St. James and Tommy Thayer in Portland, Oregon.  Originally calling themselves Movie Star, the band later chose the name Black 'N Blue based on their 'in-your-face' sound and denim and leather look. The band got their first break in 1982 when heavy metal fanzine editor Brian Slagel heard their song demo of \"Chains Around Heaven\" and subsequently added the track to his first edition of Metal Massacre — an independent compilation album that also introduced newcomers Metallica, Ratt, and Malice.\n",
      "Black 'N Blue moved to Los Angeles in 1982 making an immediate name for themselves in the Hollywood club scene. Within six months the band signed a worldwide recording contract with Geffen Records, releasing their self-titled debut album, Black 'N Blue, in August 1984. The Dieter Dierks-produced album included \"Hold On to 18,\" which was released to radio and MTV and became a moderate success, boosting album sales. A follow-up album, entitled Without Love, was released the following year.  This album saw the band modify their original rougher, hard-edge sound in favor of a more polished metal approach.  \"Miss Mystery\" was a radio success and the band toured with KISS that year.  A second track from this album, \"Nature of the Beach\" appeared in the film Vision Quest  and also appeared as the B-side to the Madonna single \"Gambler\" from the same movie, although it was not included on the soundtrack LP.\n"
