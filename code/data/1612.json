      "Ñu, also known as José Carlos Molina-Ñu, are a Spanish hard rock band formed in 1974 in Madrid. Their music style, often described as medieval rock, has medieval music, celtic rock and heavy metal influences. \nThe band have experienced multiple line-up changes, with vocalist José Carlos Molina being the only constant presence in the band through the years. The flute predominance in their sound has been compared with Jethro Tull's style, but playing a way heavier sound they are in fact a predecessor of folk metal. As time went by, their style tended to be less folk and more heavier.\nTheir lyrics usually are about medieval castles, riders, villains and heroes.\n",
      "Initially formed in 1972 as Fresa, they decided to change the band's name in 1974, so the new band would be called Ñu. Their first record was the single \"Que nadie escape de la evolución / Volando en sociedad\" released with band's no permission two years later. The discrepancies between Rosendo Mercado and Molina caused that Rosendo leave the band in order to form a new one, Leño.\nContinuous line-up changes (up to sixty different musicians have participated throughout his discography) have been related to the character of the leader, described by a critic as \"irascible, self-sufficient and undiplomatic\".\n"
