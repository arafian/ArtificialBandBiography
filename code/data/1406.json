      "The Pains of Being Pure at Heart were an American indie pop band from New York City, formed in 2007. The band centered around founding member and principal songwriter Kip Berman (vocals, guitar). In the band's final iteration, Berman was joined in concert by Christoph Hochheim (guitar), Jen Goma (keyboards, vocals), Jacob Sloan (bass), and Anton Hochheim (drums). Former members and contributors include Peggy Wang (keyboards, vocals), Connor Hanwick, Kurt Feldman and Alex Naidus.\n",
      "Kip Berman, lead singer, guitarist, and principal songwriter, grew up in Philadelphia, but moved to Portland, Oregon where he lived for several years. Berman played in numerous bands during that time. After finishing his college degree at Reed College, he moved to New York City, where he met Alex Naidus. The two bonded over their adoration for music, and their similar upbringing. Bands such as Smashing Pumpkins, The Field Mice, Black Tambourine, and Nirvana helped to establish the two as friends. Soon after, the trio played at the birthday party of friend and bandmate Peggy Wang. According to the musicians, they played \"five songs in ten minutes, and the song names were longer than the songs\". Using a backing track as a drummer, half of this setlist helped formulate the debut album.\n",
      "In late 2007, The Pains started a MySpace page to showcase their songs. Berman noted that at the time, the band name was all the group had. The name comes from the title of an unpublished children's story by Charles Augustus Steen III (a friend of Berman's), which revolves around \"realising what matters most in life – things like friendship and having a good time\". The trio began working on numerous tracks. Songs such as \"Contender\", \"Come Saturday\", and \"This Love Is Fucking Right!\" would stay band favorites, winding up on the 2009 album The Pains of Being Pure at Heart. Other tracks, such as \"Orchard of My Eye\", would be released on their first EP. It was at the time of their MySpace uploads that attention was being drawn to the act. Prominent music websites, such as Pitchfork and Stereogum, kept tabs on The Pains of Being Pure at Heart.\n"
