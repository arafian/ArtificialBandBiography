      "The East Coast Bluegrass Band, predecessor to Nothin' Fancy, was formed in 1994 to compete in the East Coast Bluegrass Championship in Crimora, Virginia.  After winning the contest, the band kept the name and continued to play together at local functions. In 1986 the group won the Virginia Folk Music Society State Bluegrass Band Championship.  The members of the band developed some original material, but remained true to the traditional style of the great bluegrass bands of the 1940s and 1950s.\n",
      "In 1998 the band released Life's Mysteries with Buster Sexton on banjo, Mike Andes on mandolin, Frankie Hawkins on guitar, Darin Lawrence on rhythm guitar, Bill Ledbetter on bass, and Buster's son Chris Sexton on fiddle.  The younger Sexton joined the group at the last minute as a replacement for Mitchell Davis, who left the group in May 1997.\n"
