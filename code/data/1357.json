      "HERTzTON is a German rock, pop, and electronica band that was formed in 2001 by author, composer, musician, singer and songwriter, Markus Winter, the band is based in Leverkusen.\n",
      "Originally, Winter performed English pop music with CRY, a band formed in 1993. The CRY album \"Invisible Tears\", released in 1995, included the Belgian radio hit \"Longing for Fire\". It was not until 2001, when a friend discovered some old recordings in a box and after listening to them, suggested Markus record them 1, that he formed HERTzTON in the same year.\n",
      "Das Album (The Album) was released the following year with Eiszeit im Paradies becoming somewhat of a local club favourite. Due to a conflict of interests the original lineup disbanded before the official release of Das Album. Winter quickly recruited two new \nmembers to complete the line up, Jürgen Zass (bass, backing vocals) and Olaf Ginko (drums). The band completed several tours \nin 2003 and 2004 to promote Das Album. At the end of 2004, Zass and Ginko would depart the band for personal reasons 1.\n"
