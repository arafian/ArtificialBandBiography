      "Delorean were a Spanish alternative dance band formed in 2000 in Zarautz, a Basque town. The band was originally composed of vocalist and bassist Ekhi Lopetegi, guitarist Tomas Palomo, keyboardist Unai Lazcano and drummer Igor Escudeo; they created the band to explore their mutual interests, from the local punk rock scene to electronic music. Palomo was replaced in 2008 by Guillermo Astrain.\n",
      "Delorean are named after the time machine featured in the Back to the Future series, which was a DeLorean car.\n",
      "The quartet released an EP and two studio albums between 2004 and 2006 to little mainstream success. In 2008, Palomo left the band and was replaced by Guillermo Astrain. Delorean subsequently relocated to Barcelona, veering towards more computer-based composition and production. Tiring of the relative low quality of the local dance music scene, the band members created their own eclectic club night, Desparrame, in which they continued the evolution of their music. Remixes for the likes of The xx, Cold Cave, and Franz Ferdinand gave Delorean exposure in the music press.\n"
