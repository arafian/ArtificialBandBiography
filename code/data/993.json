      "Lettuce is a funk band that originated in Boston, Massachusetts in 1992. Its members are guitarist Adam \"Shmeeans\" Smirnoff, Nigel Hall (keyboards, Hammond B-3 organ, piano, vocals), Adam Deitch (drums/percussion), Erick \"Jesus\" Coomes (bass), Ryan Zoidis (saxophone) and trumpeter Eric \"Benny\" Bloom.\n",
      "Lettuce began in the summer of 1992, when all of its members attended a music program at Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA as teenagers. Brought together by the influence of various funk bands including Herbie Hancock, Earth, Wind and Fire, and Tower of Power, the band jammed throughout that summer before going their separate ways.\n",
      "In the fall of 1994, the band reconvened as undergrads at Berklee and attempted to play at various Boston jazz clubs, walking in and asking the club owners and other musicians if they would \"let us play\", giving birth to the name Lettuce. Matt Butler played keyboards with the band early on and then Jeff Bhasker took on the role. When he left, Neal Evans joined.\n"
