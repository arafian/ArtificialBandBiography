      "Los Mustang is a Spanish rock band from Barcelona formed in the 1960s originally made up of Santiago \"Santi\" Carulla (vocals), Marco Rossi (solo guitar), Antonio \"Toni\" Mercadé (acoustic guitar and vocals), Miguel Navarro (bass and vocals) and Antonio \"Tony\" Mier (drums). They are best known for their Spanish language covers of songs from the 1960s and the 1970s.\n",
      "The young musicians met at San Carlos Club. Three of them (Marco Rossi, Miguel Navarro and Antonio Mercadé) were members of the group Poble-sec. Los Mustang were inspired by the style of The Shadows. With the inclusion of Santi Carulla (from rival group Los Sírex) as lead singer, the group gained fame in Barcelona with an image of professionalism and cover interpretation of international hits.\n",
      "In October 1962, Los Mustang recorded their debut album on EMI-Odeon, featuring cover versions of popular songs like \"Quinientas Millas\", Peter, Paul and Mary's \"500 Miles\", Johnny Hallyday's \"Madison Twist\", and Spanish songs \"He de saber\" and \"No lo ves\". Their repertoire consisted of many Spanish-interpreted foreign hits, but also included several original Spanish songs.\n"
