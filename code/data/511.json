   "Name": "The Waiting (band)",
   "rawData": [
      "The Waiting is a Christian alternative pop rock band, consisting of Brad Olsen (vocals), Todd Olsen (guitar), Clark Leake (bass), and Brandon Thompson (drums, percussion, loops). Since the members focus time on other aspects of their lives and take their time recording the band does not produce and perform as frequently as some other bands.\n",
      "Early albums by \"The Waiting\" were guitar driven alternative rock that drew fans with clever songwriting and introspective lyrics that stood out from most Christian rock of the day.  The band's later albums moved towards a more polished pop sound.\n",
      "In August 2003, The Waiting hit the stage in Georgia where they played a sold-out show after which they quit touring full-time to be at home more and pursue other endeavors. Even though they do not tour full-time, they never officially broke up. The Waiting still plays occasional spot dates.\n"
