      "Bigelf is an American progressive rock/progressive metal band formed in Los Angeles, California, United States, in 1991. They have since released four studio albums.\n",
      "Bigelf were formed as a psychedelic/glam-tinged hard rock outfit in 1991 in Los Angeles, California by Damon Fox and Richard Anton. They initially gained a large underground following. Bigelf's original line-up included Damon Fox (vocals/keyboards/guitar), Richard Anton (vocals/bass), A.H.M. Butler-Jones (vocals/guitar) and Thom Sullivan (drums).\n",
      "The quartet recorded 6-track EP Closer To Doom in spring 1995 co-produced by Sylvia Massy. Closer To Doom was released in 1996 and established them as 'fathers' of the psychedelic doom movement that spawned the L.A. stoner-rock scene.\nThe first line-up change came when Steve Frothingham replaced Sullivan in late 1995; soon afterward founding member Richard Anton would exit the band.\n"
