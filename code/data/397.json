      "Alisa (Russian: Алиса) is a Russian hard rock band, which is considered one of the most influential bands in the Russian rock movement.\n",
      "Alisa was formed in November 1983 by bassist Svyatoslav Zadery. The band's name originated from Zadery's nickname. The band's lineup was finally completed in 1984, when new vocalist Kostya Kinchev (real name Konstantin Panfilov) and guitarist Petr Samoylov joined. Their debut album Energia was recorded between 1985 and 1986. Energia was released by the state publishing monopoly Melodiya in 1988 and sold more than a million copies.\n",
      "The relations between Alisa's two leaders, Kinchev and Zadery, deteriorated, and Zadery left the band. This occurred just one hour before Alisa was to perform at a concert. Kino bassist Igor Tihomirov was asked to replace Zadery for one concert. Later, Zadery created his own band Nateh! (Russian: НАТЕ!, lit. 'Take that!'). Zadery died on 6 May 2011 due to complications from a stroke at the age of 50.\n"
