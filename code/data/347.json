      "Sandalspring was a Canadian folk rock band that was formed in 1968 and performed extensively at a number of Vancouver clubs until early 1970.\n",
      "Sandalspring traces its roots to 1966 when Robert Anstey formed The Scene with his brother Bruce on guitar, Soren Rasmussen on drums, Doug Hicks on bass and Jim Fisher on lead vocals. Most of their original material was written by Robert Anstey and Jim Fisher, but the group did play a number of cover songs as well. Jim Fisher was only with the group a short while, and after his departure the group continued on until the spring of 1967 when Doug Hicks was replaced by Ken Ogilvie and the band changed its name to Toad.\n",
      "In the spring of 1968 the band took on a new direction and sound when Don Ogilvie replaced Bruce Anstey as lead guitarist. At that time Robert Anstey changed the band's name to Sandalspring to fit in more with the changing times. In January 1969 Soren Rasmussen left the band and was replaced by Sean Burne. Ken Lerner was added on saxophone and flute which gave the group's sound a distinct jazzy feel.\n"
