      "Landmarq are a UK-based neo-progressive rock band. Since forming in 1990, they have so far released a total of ten albums, four of which were recorded live at various concerts in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, plus two full concert DVDs.\n",
      "Initially signing to a Dutch record company, SI Music, then forming their own label, Synergy Records, the band have established themselves within the world of progressive rock, though their style may also extend into album-oriented rock, melodic rock, hard rock and even a slightly jazz edge.\n",
      "Vocalist Damian Wilson left the band after three very well received albums to concentrate on his solo career and the band found a replacement in Ian 'Moon' Gould. 'Moon' spent a year with the band, playing various gigs in the UK and the Netherlands, before deciding to move on. It was at this point that Landmarq decided to go for a radical change to their sound and recruited the long-time friend of the band, Tracy Hitchings, who formerly sang with Quasar.\n"
