      "Savia was a Spanish alternative rock band formed in 2005 by Carlos Escobedo, the lead singer of S么ber,  with the help of Alberto Madrid, who was at that time drummer of the same band, but passed died in a car accident. Savia stayed active until year 2009.\n",
      "Carlos Escobedo's idea to form Savia started in 2004 on tour for S么ber's last album: Reddo. Because of S么ber's huge popularity at the time, Carlos Escobedo had the idea to form a new musical project and start over. The group formed in 2005 while S么ber was on hiatus. They decided to call themselves Savia, because, as Carlos Escobeda said in an interview, the definition says it all \"that which gives energy\".\n"
