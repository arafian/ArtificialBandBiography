      "Four to the Bar was a \"well loved and well respected\" American band from New York City during the early to mid-1990s.\n",
      "Four to the Bar was formed in the working-class/immigrant Irish community of Woodside, Queens, New York City, in 1991  The initial lineup was Martin Kelleher (from Cork) on bass guitar, David Yeates (from Dunboyne, County Meath) on vocals and flute, David Livingstone (from County Monaghan) on mandolin, and Gerry Singleton guitar.\n",
      "That August, Kelleher switched to guitar and the band placed a classified ad for a bass player in the Irish Voice newspaper. Patrick Clifford (from New York City) answered the ad, was hired, and completed the Kelleher-Yeates-Clifford nucleus that would hold for the remainder of the band's existence.\n"
