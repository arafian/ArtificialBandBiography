      "Red Monkey were an English DIY post-hardcore, post-riot grrrl band, active from 1996 to 2005. The band are notable for their political lyrics.\n",
      "Red Monkey was formed by Rachel Holborow, Pete Dale and Marc Walker in 1996, following on from Rachel and Pete’s earlier bands, the riot grrrl four-piece Pussycat Trash, and lo-fi duo Avocado Baby. Both acts had released records on the duo’s own record label Slampt, based in their adopted home town of Newcastle. Marc had previously drummed for Newcastle-based Post Hardcore/Rock bands Spinach and Kodiak.\n",
      "Red Monkey’s first release was the \"Do What You Feel\" EP on Slampt, followed by \"The Time Is Right\" EP on US label Troubleman Unlimited and then their debut album Make The Moment. Allmusic praised the album for its \"melodic appeal\" and the band’s \"ability to make entirely political lyrics work in a personal, intelligent manner\", while the group’s sound was compared to Gang of Four.\n"
