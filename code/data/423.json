      "Dime Store Prophets was a Christian modern rock band which was active during the mid- to late-1990s.\n",
      "Singer/Songwriter Justin Stevens and Engineer/Producer/Songwriter Masaki Liu originally formed the band  Radiation Ranch, a \"roots\" rock band with strong rockabilly influences.  With Justin writing the lyrics, melodies and most chord progressions, Masaki provided the sound with an old Telecaster guitar. With the addition of Phil Meads on drums and Sam Hernandez on bass in 1993, the band changed its name to Dime Store Prophets. The name was taken from a lyric of a \"Radiation Ranch\" song called \"Mercy Me\" (the lyric was changed before Dime Store Prophets recorded the song on the first edition of their first cd).\n",
      "Dime Store Prophets often opened for secular acts such as Joan Jett, Mudhoney, and Better Than Ezra.\n"
