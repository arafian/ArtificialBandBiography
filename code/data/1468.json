      "The Windsor Police Pipe Band is a Canadian pipe band organization based in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. The organization currently has two competing bands; one in grade 3 and another in grade 5.\n",
      "Founded in 1967, the band has grown substantially over the decades.  At one point, the organization consisted of 4 complete bands competing in various grades in Ontario and at the World Pipe Band Championships, however, that number has since dwindled down after the successive departure of 3 pipe majors in their grade 2 band (later promoted to grade 1) within a 6-year period and its subsequent folding. \n",
      "The band performs at various events and contests throughout the year in Canada and the Eastern United States, including competitions, ceremonies, parades and memorial services.\n"
