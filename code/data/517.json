      "\nSam Apple Pie were a British blues-rock band, of the late 1960s and 1970s, noted for having played at the first Glastonbury Festival in 1970, and for playing a role in the early careers of several musicians including Gary Fletcher, Dave Charles and Malcolm Morley.\n",
      "Formed in Walthamstow, London, where they ran their own club 'The Bottleneck Blues Club', Sam Apple Pie soon attracted a large live following, with a mix of goodtime blues and boogie, interspersed with humour. In October 1969 they played the Amougies Festival, in Belgium, where Frank Zappa jammed with them.\n",
      "They wrote all but one of the songs on their first album Sam Apple Pie (1969) which featured lead singer Sam \"Tomcat\" Sampson with Mike \"Tinkerbell\" Smith and Andy 'Snakehips' Johnson on guitars,; bassist Bob \"Dog\" Rennie, and Dave Charles on drums.\n"
