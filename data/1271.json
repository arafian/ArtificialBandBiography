            "In a 2010 interview with Paste, Jason Boesel said the band was taking a break but working on a compilation of unreleased songs. He also said there were no plans to release a new album in the near future.[7]\n",
            "In an April 2011 interview, Blake Sennett said, \"I would say that if Rilo Kiley were ... hmmm ... a human being ... hmmm ... he's probably laying on his back in a morgue with a tag on his toe. Now, I see movies where the dead get up and walk. And when they do that, rarely do good things happen.\"[8]\n",
            "In June 2011, when asked about his \"corpse\" comment and whether Rilo Kiley was indeed dead, Sennett said \"I never say never. I loved Rilo Kiley—I loved writing with Jenny. I think she's a great artist and great to write with. I think we're not there yet. Maybe one day we'll dust it off and give it a go; I'd be open to it. I think it was fun—for all of the pitfalls, it was great. I had a great time in Rilo Kiley. I always did.\"[9]\n",
            "A month later Sennett told AOL Spinner: \"I said, 'Fuck that, I can't do this anymore.' That being said, it was probably immature and that came from a place of ego. I think that stuff will rear its head in anything you do, depending on the personnel you surround yourself with; things change overtime  [sic] and people change and relationships change.\"\n",
            "In February 2013, the band announced a collection of previously released rarities and unreleased material, titled Rkives, to be released in April 2013 on DeReeder's own label The Little Record Company.[10]\n",
            "In a 2014 interview with the National Post, Jenny Lewis confirmed the band had officially broken up.[11]\n",
            "In April of 2015, Blake Sennett joined Jenny Lewis and her band on stage at Coachella for a performance of Rilo Kiley song “Portions for Foxes.” [12]\n",
            "Since embarking on a solo career, Jenny Lewis has enlisted the help of drummer Jason Boesel for percussion on studio recordings. He is also part of Lewis' live band for her 2019 tour.\n"

         "The group was also known for its charitable contributions, particularly to the Elliott Smith Memorial Fund, in honor of the late singer and friend of the band.

In 2007, the band contributed a t-shirt, which was designed by de Reeder for the Yellow Bird Project to benefit the Elliott Smith Memorial Fund.[6]\n"

         "On the syndicated radio show Loveline in August 2005, Sennett explained that he had a dream in which he was being chased by a sports almanac: \"when it got me, I leafed through it...and I came upon an Australian rules football player from the 19th century named Rilo Kiley. It's kind of embarrassing.\" When asked by co-host Drew Pinsky if he had ever seen this name in reality, Sennett said, \"I don't think so, I don't think that character exists...If you Google 'Rilo Kiley' you just come back with a lot of pictures of us.\" On how this imaginary name became the name for the band: \"I wrote it down on a blotter, an office desk when I woke up, and, I don't know, I came back to it when we were trying to think of a name and we thought we'd use that for one show then change it, 'cause who'd want that name? Who can remember that anyway?\"[13]\n",
         "In 2005, Sennett told Planet Sound Teletext Magazine that the name came from a Scottish athlete. On a 2005 episode of the MSNBC entertainment show MSNBC Entertainment Hot List, the female host stated that the name came from \"old Scottish sports almanacs\". In the interview segment that followed, Sennett stated, \"We just looked in there and the name of one of the star players from the turn of the century was Rilo Kiley.\"\n",
         "In an interview published in Q magazine in September 2007, Sennett stated that Rilo Kiley is named after a character he'd met in a dream who had predicted the date of Jenny Lewis' death.\n"
