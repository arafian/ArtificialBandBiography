         "The Dils were an American punk rock band formed 1976[1] and active until 1980,[2] originally from Carlsbad, California, United States, and fronted by the brothers Chip Kinman and Tony Kinman.[3] They appeared as the second act in the \"battle of the bands\" sequence in Cheech and Chong's film, Up In Smoke, where they can be heard before being seen performing \"You're Not Blank\".[4]\n"

         "Soon after forming in late 1976, The Dils relocated to San Francisco,[5] where they would have a significant influence on that city's embryonic punk scene (bassist Tony Kinman played briefly with The Avengers during 1977), and then Los Angeles, becoming one of the major bands in the early Los Angeles punk scene too.[6] They were known for their conspicuous radical left politics,[1] and for a strong melodic sense that earned them the nickname \"punk rock Everly Brothers\".[7]\n",
         "Their debut single was \"I Hate The Rich\" / \"You're Not Blank\" (the latter covered by the Minneapolis punk band Dillinger Four), on Los Angeles-based label What? Records, released in 1977. The second single, \"Class War\", was released on DangerHouse Records.[8] The band relocated to San Francisco in 1977.[8]\n",
         "Their next record was their critical high-point, 1977's \"Class War\" / \"Mr. Big\" (the former covered by Canadian punks D.O.A.), issued on Dangerhouse label, in a pressing of 1500 copies entitled \"198 Seconds Of The Dils\". The last contemporary release was a three-sided double-7\" in 1980, \"Made In Canada\", produced by Bob Rock, which showed a gathering roots rock orientation. The Dils opened for The Clash in Santa Monica[9] in 1980 and later that year the band dissolved[9] after playing a final show with Black Flag.[10]\n",
         "Music from The Dils (including material unreleased during the band's lifetime) remains available.\n"

         "The Kinmans continued to follow the roots rock direction, giving birth to the new \"cowpunk\" genre with their band Rank and File in the 1980s, along with Alejandro Escovedo,[3] then shed a spotlight on \"cowboy music\" with Cowboy Nation in the 1990s.[11] Other stops on the Kinmans' musical trail included a rock guitar and drum-machine noise project, Blackbird.[11] In 2018, The Kinman brothers reunited for Chip's new band, Ford Madox Ford.[11] Released by Porterhouse records, Ford Madox Ford's debut album, This American Blues, featured Chip on vocals and guitar, Dewey Peek (Giuliano Scarfo) on lead guitar, Matt Littell on bass and S. Scott Aguero on drums, and Tony Kinman as producer.\n",

         "Chip Kinman revived The Dils in 2019,[12] with the first show at The Grand Star Jazz Club in Los Angeles' Chinatown on January 27. The following night, The Dils played at San Diego's Casbah Club. Joining Kinman was his stepson Giuliano Scarfo on drums, plus Brian Melendez on bass and backing vocals.[5]\n"
