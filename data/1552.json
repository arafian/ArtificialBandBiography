         "The song was one of four compositions written by Ukigumo that appear on Sports, including the songs \"Fair\", \"Foul\" and \"Kimaru\".[5] \"Season Sayonara\" and \"Foul\" were two songs that were part of Ukigumo's already existing stock of songs, that were not written specifically for the album. These two were songs that vocalist Ringo Sheena had heard in the past, and considered \"sporty\", fitting the theme of the album.[6] \"Season Sayonara\" and \"Fair\" were the first two songs recorded for the album (excluding \"Senkō Shōjo\", which was recorded during the Variety sessions)[6][7] Ukigumo liked Ichiyo Izawa's piano backing for the song, as he had struggled to consider how he himself could back the song on the guitar.[6]\n",
         "The song is primarily sung in Japanese by vocalist Sheena, with additional background vocals by Ukigumo. Lyrically, the song deals with someone looking back at a failed relationship, while making references to different seasons.[8]\n"
