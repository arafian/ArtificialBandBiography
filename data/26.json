      "Nena Daconte (Spanish pronunciation: ) is a Spanish pop band created and led by singer and composer Mai Meneses in Barcelona circa 2005. The band takes its name inspired by a character from the short story \"The Trail Of Your Blood On The Snow\", by Gabriel García Márquez.\n",
      " \n\"The Trail of Your Blood in the Snow\" depicts the opposite extreme of the social spectrum. Billy Sánchez, the spoiled son of a rich Colombian, is honeymooning with his bride, Nena Daconte, in Europe, when the girl inexplicably pricks herself with a thorn and bleeds to death. When the wound initially occurs, Billy is too self-absorbed to pay much attention, but he finally realizes that something is seriously wrong and deposits his young wife in a hospital in Paris.                                                                                                                                        ",
      "Fanlo left the formation and Mai Meneses continues as the lead singer and songwriter of Nena Daconte.  Before the creation of Nena Daconte, Mai Meneses participated in the second edition of a Spanish TV singing contest called Operacion Triunfo.\n"
