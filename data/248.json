      "The Johnson Mountain Boys were a popular bluegrass band throughout the 1980s from the Washington, D.C. area.  Their style favored a more traditional approach to bluegrass than some of their contemporaries.  They released two 45 RPM single records, one EP record, ten albums and toured widely, playing venues such as Madison Square Garden, The White House, the Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, and the Grand Ole Opry in the United States.  Other tours took them around the world to Canada, England, Japan, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa.  The group was frequently recognized with nominations for Grammy Awards, International Bluegrass Music Awards, and awards from the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music in America.  Many of the band's members are still active in other musical groups and settings.\n",
      "In 2020, the band were inducted into the Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame.\n",
      "The first grouping initially known as \"The Johnson Boys\", formed in 1975 as a duo featuring Dudley Connell on banjo and Ron Welch on guitar.  Eddie D'Zmura, a high school friend of Dudley Connell's, joined soon thereafter on mandolin. The band was renamed, \"The Johnson Mountain Boys\" after learning of another folk band already using the \"Johnson Boys\" name. The name The Johnson Mountain Boys was suggested by George Connell, Dudley's father. The \"Johnson Mountain\" referred to in the name of the band is a fictitious name (i.e. there is no Johnson Mountain in any of the areas from which any of the band members came).  The group became a full five-piece band in January 1978 featuring Connell on guitar, Franny Davidson on banjo—replaced by Richard Underwood after the band's first recording session—Eddie D'Zmura on mandolin, David McLaughlin on fiddle, and Gary Reid on bass.  Gary Reid left the group in late 1978 and started the Copper Creek record company.  He was replaced by Mark Prindle on the bass.  The Johnson Mountain Boys first commercial record release was Copper Creek Records number 0001 featuring original instrumental composition \"Johnson Mountain Hoedown\" written by Dudley Connell and Ed D'Zmura. The B side was \"When I Can Forget\" a song written by Dudley Connell.  The personnel on the record was Dudley Connell on guitar and vocals, David McLaughlin on fiddle and vocals, Ed D'Zmura on mandolin, Franny Davidson on banjo, and Mark Prindle on bass.  After the release of the first Copper Creek single, David McLaughlin went off to college and continued to play fiddle part-time with the band.  After David McLaughlin left for college, Eddie Stubbs performed his first show on fiddle with the Johnson Mountain Boys in November 1978 when he was just 16 years old, just a week before his 17th birthday.  From that point, he was considered the main fiddle player for the group, but played only once per week with the group since he was still in high school (senior year).  Since Eddie was not able to perform every show because of school, the fiddle duties were covered by David McLaughlin, Bill Belford, and Carl Nelson when Eddie was not able to appear.  In May 1979, Eddie became the full-time fiddle player for the group at age 17.  He graduated from Gaithersburg High School that June.  In 1979, before the recording of their second Copper Creek record, Mark Prindle was replaced by Larry Robbins on bass.  The group's second record was Copper Creek Records number 0101, an EP featuring \"Sitting Alone in the Moonlight,\" \"Eddie's Hoedown,\" \"Where We'll Never Die,\" and \"No Depression in Heaven.\"  In 1980, the band was picked up by Rounder Records.  The group's self-titled first album won considerable acclaim.  After the release of their first Rounder album, David McLaughlin left college in early 1981 to rejoin the group full-time, replacing Ed D'Zmura on mandolin.  Subsequent albums made the group young standard bearers of traditional bluegrass in the 1980s. In 1986, there were two personnel changes. Marshall Wilborn replaced Larry Robbins on bass in June and Tom Adams replaced Richard Underwood on banjo in September.\n"
