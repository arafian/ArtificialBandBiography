         "Parts & Labor was an American rock band formed in 2002 by B. J. Warshaw and Dan Friel in Brooklyn, New York. Drummer Joe Wong joined the band in 2007. Parts & Labor released five albums, two EPs, one split album (with Tyondai Braxton), and numerous 7\"s and compilation tracks. Their music is influenced by DIY punk, experimental/psychedelic rock, and lo-fi electronic music.\n",

On July 10, 2009, Lipstate announced via her website she had left the band.[3]\n",
