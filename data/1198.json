      "Formation (2009–10)": {
         "text": [
            "Grouplove formed out of a friendship among the five members of the band. Hooper met Zucconi on the Lower East Side of Manhattan after hearing and enjoying his music from his former band ALOKE. Despite having just met, Hooper invited Zucconi to an artist residency in Crete she was leaving for later that week.[2]  It was at the Ikarus artist commune in the village of Avdou where they met the rest of the band, Andrew Wessen, Ryan Rabin, and Sean Gadd. Rabin, an accomplished drummer and producer, grew up in Los Angeles with Wessen, a surfer and guitarist. Rabin comes from a musical family – his father is Trevor Rabin, former guitarist of Yes. Sean Gadd, a songwriter and guitarist from London, was also at the commune. The friendship between the members formed quickly, but the band did not form until a year later after Gadd, Zucconi and Hooper pooled their funds together and made a trip to Rabin's Los Angeles recording studio. They played their first show at El Cid in Los Angeles on May 10, 2010.  Later that year, the band went on tour with Florence and the Machine on the west coast, and then the Joy Formidable on the east coast. By November, Nylon Magazine recognized Grouplove as one of the top ten in the \"Best New Bands in 2010.\"[3]\n",
            "Before even signing with Canvasback/Atlantic Records the band was in a money rut and had to license the song \"Getaway Car\" to HBO's \"How to Make it In America\" just to get by.[4] Eventually the band was signed and decided to re-release their self-titled EP, Grouplove, on January 25, 2011.  In 2011, the band co-headlined a cross-country tour with Foster the People, and made appearances at Lollapalooza, Outside Lands, Reading and Leeds Festivals, and Glastonbury.[5]\n"
