         "The Black Belles formed in 2009 originally with Erin Belle. Bassist Ruby Rogers said \"She helped us out in the studio, and we needed someone with more of a commitment. She's also a model. Her scheduling didn't work out. We just haven't communicated that to a lot of people.\"[3] They quickly signed to Third Man Records and released three singles: \"Elvira\", \"What Can I Do\", and \"Charlene\" with Stephen Colbert, which they performed live on The Colbert Report.[4] Regarding their start with Third Man Records, Olivia Jean said, \"I had a recording that I gave to Jack, and it was mostly instrumental music, but it was a jumping-off point for like, some project to begin. I did it for myself, but I didn't play anything live, because I didn't have a band. But once we all met, we kind of collaborated together and shared ideas, threw all those ideas together and we had a lot of material to work with.\"[3]\n",
         "In 2011, they released their debut self-titled album which had two singles: \"Honky Tonk Horror\" and \"Wishing Well\".[5] The album was produced by Jack White and recorded in the course of a few months. Rogers said \"We did it really fast, and then we recorded it really fast, too.\"[3] It received mildly positive reviews, achieving a Metacritic score of 59.[6]\n",
