      "The Indecent were an American-Canadian alternative rock band band based in New York City, featuring triplets Emily, Madeline, and Bo Brout, along with Windsor, Ontario, Canada-based Nicholas Burrows The band emerged from the local music scene, garnering a significant amount of attention for their age and style. The Indecent was signed to Warner Bros. Records in early 2011.\n",
      "The Brout triplets were born on May 28, 1994, and have been performing together since the age of 8.  They came together formally as The Indecent in the summer of 2008, originally under the aegis of producers Stuart Chatwood and musician and former record executive Tim Sommer.  Around this time, Chatwood suggested to the group that drummer Nicholas Burrows (born October 8, 1995), the son of Tea Party and Crash Karma drummer Jeff Burrows, join the band.  In the spring of 2010, the band went into the Cutting Room Studio and Shelter Island Sound Studio, both in New York City, with Sommer producing, and Mark Dearnley engineering and mixing, and the band's first album, Her Screwed Up Head, was released on June 15, 2010.\n",
      "The band first gained attention with a music video featuring a cover of \"White Rabbit\" by Jefferson Airplane, soon followed by a video for their own song. The band's first video from their debut album, Her Screwed Up Head, \"25 Steps,\" was directed by  Noah Hutton.  Following this, the band released three more videos:  \"Soybean\" (also from the album), \"Lucky Ones\" (a new track, produced by Julian Raymond and Tim Sommer), and a new version of the song \"Her Screwed Up Head,\" also produced by Raymond and Sommer.  \n"
