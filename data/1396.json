         "The Brout triplets were born on May 28, 1994, and have been performing together since the age of 8.  They came together formally as The Indecent in the summer of 2008, originally under the aegis of producers Stuart Chatwood and musician and former record executive Tim Sommer.  Around this time, Chatwood suggested to the group that drummer Nicholas Burrows (born October 8, 1995), the son of Tea Party and Crash Karma drummer Jeff Burrows, join the band.  In the spring of 2010, the band went into the Cutting Room Studio and Shelter Island Sound Studio, both in New York City, with Sommer producing, and Mark Dearnley engineering and mixing, and the band's first album, Her Screwed Up Head, was released on June 15, 2010.\n"

         "The band first gained attention with a music video featuring a cover of \"White Rabbit\" by Jefferson Airplane, soon followed by a video for their own song. The band's first video from their debut album, Her Screwed Up Head, \"25 Steps,\"[3] was directed by  Noah Hutton.  Following this, the band released three more videos:  \"Soybean\" (also from the album), \"Lucky Ones\" (a new track, produced by Julian Raymond and Tim Sommer), and a new version of the song \"Her Screwed Up Head,\" also produced by Raymond and Sommer.  \n",
         "In March 2011, it was announced that the band had signed to Warner Bros. Records,[2] as the first new-artist signing by the label's new chairman, Rob Cavallo.  \nIn April 2011, the band appeared on the cover of the British music/fashion magazine, Disorder.[4]\n",
         "On September 30 and October 1, 2011, The Indecent played their inaugural shows in the UK, at Manchester Academy and O2 Academy Islington[5]\n",
         "In June 2011, The Indecent began recording their first major label album, with Cavallo producing, in Los Angeles. On September 18, 2012, they released the Warner Bros. debut, a 5-song EP titled Control.  The EP was culled from sessions that took place in the summer of 2011 with Rob Cavallo and Julian Raymond producing, along with some material recorded in the summer of 2010, with Raymond and Sommer again producing.  The entire EP was mixed by Doug McKean. The band shot four videos for the EP, each directed by Noah Hutton, for the songs \"Here Comes Another,\" \"Control,\" \"Hear Them Fear Them,\" and the re-recorded version of \"Lucky Ones.\"  The EP also features one hidden track, a guitar/drum freak-out titled \"Mating Call,\" which follows the EP's final track after about twenty seconds of silence.\n",
