         "After the release of vocalist Ringo Sheena's third album, Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana in 2003, Sheena embarked on a nationwide tour entitled Sugoroku Ecstasy. Sheena asked the backing members well in advance to perform for the tour, so that her first choices would not be double-booked.[1] These members were dubbed Tokyo Jihen, a name that was publicised during the tour.[2] During the tour, the song \"Ringo no Uta\" was briefly performed, which was released as a single by Sheena on November 25, 2003.[3] Tokyo Jihen was officially announced as Sheena's main musical unit on May 31, 2004, and first performed at a series of summer music festivals: 0724 Yamabikari at Kobe Chicken George on July 24, Meet the World Beat on July 25, 2004 in Suita, Osaka, the Fuji Rock Festival in Niigata Prefecture on July 30 and the SunSet Live 2004 festival in Fukuoka Prefecture on September 3.[4][5]\n",
         "The concert tour was first announced in September 2004, before the release of the band's first single, \"Gunjō Biyori\".[6] The band released a second single in October, \"Sōnan\", followed by their full-length album Kyōiku in December.\n",
         "After the concerts, members Mikio Hirama and H Zetto M decided to leave the band; Hirama to focus on his solo work and H Zetto M to focus on performing as a member of Pe'z. These announcements were made together on July 1, 2005, before the release of the Dynamite In and Dynamite Out video albums.[7]\n"
