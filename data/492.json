         "Silage produced a few independent albums before being signed to Sub*Lime Records, including \"Holy Cow Food! Bagman!\" in 1996 on the Sonfish Records imprint (featuring partial vocals and bass by A-F Records recording artist Ean Elliot Clevenger), Liquid Spatula.[citation needed] after signing onto the artist management company founded by Paul Gunther and Rob Poznanski, Straight Up Music, Silage was quickly signed onto Jive Records/SubLime Records. Silage's first album, Watusi (1997) saw a blend of ska, punk and hip-hop[1] heralded mostly by the Christian underground punk scene. For their next release, Silage modified their sound to bring pop and hip-hop influences to the fore.[3][4] This new sound produced their more successful album, Vegas Car Chasers (1998). The most notable songs from this album are \"Billboards,\" which garnered the No. 6 spot on Christian music charts in 1998; and \"Verb,\" which was graced by the rap stylings of Knowdaverbs, and achieved No. 7 on the same chart the next year.[5]\n"
