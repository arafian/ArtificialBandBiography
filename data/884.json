      "Jared Bell says the intentional misspelling of the Limbic System was to own it, lamenting comparisons to Lynyrd Skynyrd. For much of the recording of their 2012 album, Symbolyst the brothers were not in the same state. \"Our first full length when we lived in the same house in south Scottsdale, we were treating it like a job and we literally worked on it every day until it was done,\" Michael Bell has explained. \"After that, it morphed into a process of exchanging ideas online ... Even when we lived in New York, we never met up until the end. We worked on stuff separately and exchanged ideas \"\n"
