         "Nails is an American hardcore punk band from Oxnard, California.[2] The group was formed in 2009 by frontman Todd Jones, formerly the guitarist of Terror,[3] along with bassist John Gianelli and drummer Taylor Young of Disgrace. They released their debut EP Obscene Humanity in 2009, followed by the studio albums Unsilent Death (2010), Abandon All Life (2013) and You Will Never Be One of Us (2016), and a split EP with Full of Hell.

         "In a review of Abandon All Life, Pitchfork wrote that \"Nails cram their brief but constantly shifting tracks with a chaotic, complex blend of hardcore punk, D-beat, grindcore, powerviolence, and death metal.\"[10] In a 2013 interview for Invisible Oranges, Todd Jones named crust punk, death metal, and Japanese hardcore as the band's foremost musical influences.[11] Rushonrock cited Nails, alongside Trap Them, as key players of the contemporary American crust scene.[12]\n"
