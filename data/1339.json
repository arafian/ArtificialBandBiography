      "Red Alert's original line-up — Steve 'Cast Iron' Smith (vocals), Tony Van Frater (guitar), Gaz Stuart (bass) and Dona (drums) — debuted in the summer of 1979, at a carnival in Sunderland, performing mostly Clash and UK Subs covers.\n",
      "Their first demo became their debut release: a self-financed four track EP Third And Final, only 250 copies of which were pressed and then sold at gigs. With the new drummer Mitch the band produced its second demo In Britain and recorded two tracks for the Carry On Oi! compilation, only one of which -\"SPG\"- was included. Gary Bushell suggested that the band should send their material to No Future Records which they did and were signed a week later.\n"
