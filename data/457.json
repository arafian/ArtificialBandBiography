      "Leviticus was a Christian metal band from Sweden. The band formed in 1981 and was led by Bjorn Stigsson. They released four albums before breaking up in 1990.\n",
      "The band's early releases were metal with symphonic influences using the Roland synthesizer guitar and Moog Taurus pedals. Knights of Heaven showed a move toward a more melodic rock based sound.\n",
      "In 1986 the band went through lineup changes: Ez Gomér was brought in to replace Håkan Andersson on bass, and Terry Haw joined. Both were with the band through Setting Fire to the Earth (1987), then left to form Jet Circus. With this lineup they toured extensively in Europe throughout 1986–1987.\n"
