            "KSM was formed in a joint project between The Walt Disney Company and former chart-topping girl band The Go-Go's.[4] The Go-Go's were looking for an all-girl pop band to mentor and held auditions in 2006. Four musicians (Padilla, Cecil, Cabebe, and Melon; all age 13-15 at the time) were selected and the group was originally developed as a Go-Go's cover band called the Po-Go's. Disney planned to replicate its success with Devo 2.0, a kids' version of the '80s new wave band Devo, with the possibility of the Po-Go's appearing in a movie or TV series.[5][6][7] Eventually the band's sound was changed from pop to rock, and with the addition of lead singer Shelby Cobra (real last name Spalione) in February 2008,[8] they changed their name to KSM. Around that time, the Go-Go's ended their involvement with the project.[6]\n"

They toured as an opening act for fellow Disney recording artists Mitchel Musso,[9] Demi Lovato,[10] and Jonas Brothers,[11] as well as opening for Paramore and David Archuleta.[12] KSM's journey as they approached and then supported the release of their debut album was documented in the bi-weekly reality web series called, KSM: Read Between the Lines which aired from August 10, 2009 to October 16, 2009 on www.teen.com. The 20-episode web series was produced by The Disney Music Group and The Jonas Group.[13] On September 22, 2009, KSM released their debut album Read Between the Lines, which was written and produced by Matthew Gerrard and Robbie Nevil.[5]  KSM performed on Good Morning America on October 8, 2009[14][15] and on The Rachael Ray Show on October 12, 2009.[16]\n",
            "The band confirmed in April 2010 that bassist Sophia Melon departed to attend Barnard College.[17] In August 2010 KSM confirmed that they had broken up to pursue separate careers.[18] In October 2010, lead guitarist Shae Padilla formed a new hard rock band called Rixy Fisk, which briefly included Shelby Spalione (no longer using the \"Cobra\" stage name) on vocals.[19][20] Padilla's band was later called FireSky,[21][22] which released the EP Erase the Enemy in August 2011. Drummer Kate Cabebe attended California Lutheran University and has worked for Cambio.com as a correspondent.[citation needed] Spalione released the dance-pop single \"Overrated Friday\" under the name Lio in late 2011 and again under the name Shelby in early 2012; she has also performed with will.i.am.[23] Rhythm guitarist Katie Cecil had been a child actress before KSM, and earned small roles in the TV series Medium, Criminal Minds, and Help Me Help You.[24] Starting in 2015, Cecil is lead singer for the indie-pop band Wayfarers.[25]\n"
