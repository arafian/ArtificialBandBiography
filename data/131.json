         "The band first came to prominence in 1969 when rock impresario Bill Graham signed them after an audition and they played the Fillmore West in San Francisco.[1] Pense has been compared to Janis Joplin, and it was Joplin who recommended the audition to Graham.\n",
         "The term \"East Bay Grease\" has been used to describe the San Francisco Bay Area's brass horn heavy funk-rock sound of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, Cold Blood was one of the pioneer bands of this sound.[2] Other bands include Tower of Power, Chicago, and Blood Sweat And Tears.[2] The Tower of Power horn players have performed with Cold Blood on a regular basis since the early 1970s. Skip Mesquite and Mic Gillette have been members of both Tower of Power and Cold Blood.[3][4]\n",
         "The band disbanded in the late 1970s. Pense suspended her music career in the early 1980s to raise her daughter Danielle, before re-forming the group in 1988.[2] The band stabilized with its current membership in the 1990s.[citation needed] Cold Blood continues to record and perform today, and some former band members such as Raul Matute (and some from Tower of Power) appear on the band's most recent album.\n",
         "Cold Blood is featured playing \"You Got Me Humminâ€™\" live in Fillmore: The Last Days, a documentary of the last concerts at the Fillmore West auditorium during July 1971.[5]\n"
