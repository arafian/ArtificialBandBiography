      "Gore Gore Girls are an all female garage rock band from Detroit, Michigan, formed in 1997 by singer/songwriter Amy Gore. The band's name comes from The Gore Gore Girls, a 1972 B-movie by Herschell Gordon Lewis, which is a parody of the term Go Go Girls.\n",
      "Like fellow Detroit bands The White Stripes and The Detroit Cobras, the band started out struggling through the local club circuit before being \"discovered\" by independent record label Get Hip Records in 1998. Their first single \"Mama in the Movies\" (1999) gained favourable airplay on college radio stations in Michigan, which led to recording their first full-length album Strange Girls in (2000). The second album Up All Night, was released in 2002 and received positive press from the Village Voice and Detroit Free Press. During this time the band toured Europe twice, in 2002 and in 2003, also with infrequent dates in the United States.\n",
      "The band became a four-piece in 2004 with the addition of The Hammer (Marlene Hammerle) on guitar and began touring the United States extensively. Gore Gore Girls toured as direct support for The Cramps in 2003 and 2004. The band released an EP in 2004, 7 X 4, which became part of their third album, Get the Gore. Tracks from the EP and subsequent third album received airplay on Little Steven's Underground Garage Program on Sirius Satellite Radio; the band was featured at Little Steven's Underground Garage Festival on Randall's Island, New York along with other 'garage rock' luminaries and legends The Stooges, The Strokes, The New York Dolls, The Zombies and others.  Get the Gore, released in 2007 on Bloodshot Records, was recorded at Ghetto Recorders in Detroit, Michigan and received positive press from USA Today and Playboy Magazine.\n"
