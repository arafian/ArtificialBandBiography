      "Soulhat is an American rock band from Texas. The group formed in 1990 around the nucleus of Kevin McKinney, Bill Cassis, and Brian Walsh; Barry E. \"Frosty\" Smith, who had previously played drums with Lee Michaels and Funkadelic, joined soon after: at first playing percussion alongside, and eventually replacing original drummer Ian Bailey. Their self-released debut followed in 1993, and was reissued after they signed to Epic Records later that year. Their single \"Bonecrusher\" peaked at #25 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock charts. A follow-up studio album appeared in 1994, and a third in 2000.\n",
