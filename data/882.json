   "rawData": [
      "Laika & the Cosmonauts were a Finnish rock band.  They had the same lineup from the time they formed in 1987 until they stopped recording in 2008. The band was named after Laika, a Soviet space dog that died on board Sputnik 2 in 1957.\n",
      "Their sound is usually described as surf rock, but a Boston Globe review noted that the band's sound is \"far beyond the limitations of any specific genre.\" They relied heavily on the Finnish rautalanka (electric guitar) tradition. The band toured the United States and Europe several times and although relatively unknown in the United States, their music was admired by many musicians, including Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench (of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers), Mike Palm of Agent Orange, and Surf Rock legend Dick Dale. Al Jourgensen of Ministry called them \"the best f**king band in the world.\"\n",
      "In addition to their touring, the band appeared several times on European television.\n"
