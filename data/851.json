         "Chon endorses Ibanez guitars and Overdrive Straps guitar straps. Guitarist Mario Camarena currently plays his signature Ibanez guitar, the MAR10, which is based on an Ibanez AZ series prototype in pink with a white pickguard. Earlier, he used the pink prototype in addition to a white Ibanez AZ prototype that went on to become a regular AZ Prestige model, as well as an Ibanez RG652fx with a custom floral print (including a black version of Yoshi, which Mario uses as his main character in the video game Super Smash Bros.), and an Ibanez S5521Q. He could also often be seen playing a custom Ibanez RG created by Seth Hollander.[9]\n",
         "Before Chon's \"Homey\" album, Mario used a Vox AC30 tube amplifier and a Fender Super Sonic but has now switched to a Matchless amplifier. Erick Hansel primarily plays his signature Ibanez guitar, the EH10, which is based on the Ibanez AZ series. Earlier, he used a dark blue Ibanez AZ prototype, an RG652FX with a custom paint dip, an RG321MH (on early albums and performances), and an Ibanez Talman Prestige. Recently, Erick has been seen with either a Vox AC30 or a Matchless amplifier. Chon's early work was known to largely shun the use of effects pedals, but the band has since started experimenting heavily with pedals during the writing process for Homey.[10][11]\n"

   "Musical style and influences": {
      "text": [
         "In the early days the band were influenced by metal bands such as Necrophagist and post-hardcore band The Fall of Troy, but the band have also listed pianists such as Hiromi Uehara, Tigran Hamasyan, and Alex Argento as influences in their sound. Chon's music is noted for its use of complex harmony with heavy emphasis on extended chords, as well as the odd time signatures and polyrhythms typical of the progressive rock genre. Their second album, Homey, saw the band incorporating elements of trip-hop and electronic music, which can be heard in tracks such as 'Nayhoo.'\n"
