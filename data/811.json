      "The Haunted is a heavy metal band from Gothenburg, Sweden formed in 1996.\nThe original members were Anders and Jonas Björler, Peter Dolving, Adrian Erlandsson and Patrik Jensen. Both of the Björler brothers and Erlandsson were members of the seminal melodic death metal band At the Gates, a pioneering force in the Swedish death metal scene.\n",
