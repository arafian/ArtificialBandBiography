      "The Dry Branch Fire Squad is a traditional-style bluegrass band fronted by Ron Thomason. The band is known for its showy performances and for Thomason's humorous interludes.  The Dry Branch Fire Squad is the host band of Grey Fox Bluegrass Festival, formerly called the Winterhawk Bluegrass Festival.  The band also hosts the High Mountain Hay Fever festival in Colorado as a fundraiser for a local medical clinic.\n",
      "Dry Branch Fire Squad was founded by Thomason, a former member of the Clinch Mountain Boys, in October 1976.  The band has gone through many lineup changes; Thomason has been the one constant, serving as the band's MC, lead singer, and mandolin player.  He also plays banjo and guitar on occasion, and during performances often demonstrates hambone technique which he learned as a child.\n",
      "In 1978 the band released a self-titled debut album, and in 1979 they performed at Bill Monroe's Bean Blossom Festival.\n"
