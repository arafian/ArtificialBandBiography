Released in July 1994, the album's popularity grew after its release, becoming the best-selling album of 1995, and was one of the fastest-selling debut albums of all time. The album, which was certified platinum in the United States in January 1995 and incrementally rose to 12x platinum by January 1996 and 16x platinum by March 1999. In May 2019, the certifications level was updated from 16x platinum to 21x platinum.\n",
            "The album featured four hits, \"Hold My Hand\" (U.S. No. 10), \"Let Her Cry\" (U.S. No. 9), \"Only Wanna Be with You\" (U.S. No. 6), and \"Time\" (U.S. No. 14).[8] The album's last single, \"Drowning\", was not as successful as its predecessors, peaking only on the Mainstream Rock chart. In 1995, Hootie & the Blowfish and Bob Dylan reached an out-of-court settlement for the group's unauthorized use of Dylan's lyrics in their song \"Only Wanna Be with You\".[9] Miami Dolphins' Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino appeared in the band's video for the song \"Only Wanna Be with You\", along with several other athletes.[10]\n"

It contained the hit single \"Old Man and Me\" (U.S. No. 13), and sold four million copies in the United States. Hootie & the Blowfish has since released three more studio albums: Musical Chairs, Hootie & the Blowfish and Looking for Lucky. They also released a B-sides and rarities compilation titled Scattered, Smothered and Covered (2000). This album is named in tribute of Waffle House, a popular Southern chain of all-night diners. Specifically, the title refers to an order of hash browns scattered on the grill, smothered with diced onions and covered with melted cheese.[11]\n",
