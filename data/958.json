            "Dopapod was formed at Boston's Berklee College of Music in 2008, as a duo with Eli Winderman and drummer Michelangelo Carubba. [6] They performed in this format around New England for a year or so before adding Rob Compa on guitar another Berklee student.  After a year as a trio, they added Chuck Jones on bass—who at the time had another band and with Winderman called The Actual Proof[citation needed]—and Neal Evans on percussion.[7] In 2010, Carubba became the full-time drummer for Turkuaz and Evans took over drums for Dopapod.[8][7] The band split with Evans in 2013, and he was replaced by Scotty Zwang until Evans returned in 2016.[9]\n"
