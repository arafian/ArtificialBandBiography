      "Dopapod is an American rock band from Boston, Massachusetts. The current lineup includes keyboardist/vocalist Eli Winderman, guitarist/vocalist Rob Compa, bassist Chuck Jones, drummer Neal “Fro” Evans, and lighting director Luke Stratton. Although classified as a jam band, Dopapod incorporates bits of funk, heavy metal, jazz fusion, and country. They have self-released five studio albums, and spend most of their time touring.\n",
      "Dopapod was formed at Boston's Berklee College of Music in 2008, as a duo with Eli Winderman and drummer Michelangelo Carubba.  They performed in this format around New England for a year or so before adding Rob Compa on guitar another Berklee student.  After a year as a trio, they added Chuck Jones on bass—who at the time had another band and with Winderman called The Actual Proof—and Neal Evans on percussion. In 2010, Carubba became the full-time drummer for Turkuaz and Evans took over drums for Dopapod. The band split with Evans in 2013, and he was replaced by Scotty Zwang until Evans returned in 2016.\n",
      "After releasing their debut album, Radar in 2009, Dopapod began touring the next year on their own and on bills with other artists. The band appeared on the 2015 Bonnaroo lineup and was cited by  Rolling Stone as Bonnaroo's “Best-Kept Secret” comparing them to Phish, Disco Biscuits and Frank Zappa.\n"
