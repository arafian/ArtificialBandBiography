         "In the early 1970s, Anne Linnet used to be in the band Tears along with her husband Holger Laumann. Holger had the idea of a girl band and suggested two recruits from Århus Friskole (Århus Free School), namely Astrid Elbæk and Ulla Tvede Eriksen to join Anne to form a band. Soon Lis Sørensen also joined in. They practiced at Ulla's parents house near Brabrand Lake in Aarhus.\n",
         "In 1975 there they took part in women-only Kvindefestival i Fælledparken in Copenhagen. After black American activist Angela Davis spoke, Shit & Chanel came on stage with an accompanying male-band Delta Blues Band playing for them, which immediately brought protests against the band by liberation movement organizers who had specified that this was an all-women event.[2]\n",
         "They released their eponymous début album Shit & Chanel that contained \"Smuk og dejlig\" that became very popular and a classic rock song in Denmark and subject to many covers including Kulturkanonen in 2006 and Natasja Saad in 2007 just before her death. The last studio of the band was in 1979.\n",
         "In 1981, after Chanel threatened to sue the band for the derogative connotations of its adopted name, the band changed its name to Shit & Chalou. It disbanded 1 year later, in 1982.\n",
         "In 2012, a compilation album of their best hits was released, but credited to Shit & Chalou,[2] although all the recordings had been made under Shit & Chanel. The compilation contains the four original albums of the band, a bonus CD with live material and other unreleased material.\n"
