      "Spires That in the Sunset Rise is an American psychedelic folk band from Decatur, Illinois. The four original members of the band (Kathleen Baird, Georgia Vallas, Taralie Peterson, and Tracy Peterson) grew up together in Decatur, Illinois, eventually moving to Chicago, Illinois where they began to experiment with creating songs. Drawing from experimental and multi-cultural music, they created an individual sound which they debuted on their first self-titled album Spires That in the Sunset Rise.\n\nThe first album was created without Taralie's sister Tracy Peterson, but she soon joined the group before the making of their second album 'Four Winds the Walker.' A year later they created their third album 'This Is Fire' which today is considered one of their most accessible albums thus far. Since the release of their first album, they have contributed a different slant to the New Folk movement by incorporating avant garde influences resulting in a completely unique sound. Their music has drawn comparisons to The Raincoats, Current 93, Comus, and The Ex, and they have toured throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe.\n",
      "In 2012 the band (now a duo of long-term members Kathleen Baird and Taralie Peterson) released their fifth full-length album, 'Ancient Patience Wills It Again'\n"
