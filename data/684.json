            "The members of Katzenjammer met in 2004 while studying at a private music school in Oslo.[1][2] The band was formed in 2007 while listening to Anne Marit Bergheim perform the song \"Wading in Deeper\" on the piano. They were brought together by a common feeling of being \"the outcasts at the school.\" Katzenjammer felt that their music school didn't encourage originality, but \"only wanted to teach what had been done.\"[1]\n",
            "The band is named after the Katzenjammer Kids, the oldest comic strip continually in syndication.[3] They chose this comic strip because they noticed that they resembled the characters in it.[4] The term Katzenjammer is a German loanword that literally means \"lament of a cat\", and is used in Norway to describe low-grade music and instrumentation (which in Germany would be called Katzenmusik - \"music by cats\").\n"

            "A Kiss Before You Go, Katzenjammer's second album, was released in September 2011. The album's lyrics and visual direction were inspired by the French film The City of Lost Children, a maritime fantasy adventure.[14]\n",
