      "La Luz is known for their \"surf noir\" style, with layered vocal harmonies. Their energetic live shows often include Soul Train-inspired dance contests and crowd surfing.\n",
      "Shana Cleveland and Marian Li Pino (former members of Seattle band The Curious Mystery) formed La Luz in Seattle, Washington with Alice Sandahl and bassist Abbey Blackwell after being inspired by surf and rock and roll acts like Link Wray, The Ventures, and Dick Dale, as well as girl groups like The Shirelles. Cleveland has cited Japanese guitar player Takeshi Terauchi as her biggest guitar influence. After releasing an EP titled Damp Face in 2012, La Luz signed with Hardly Art. They released their first full-length album, It's Alive, on Hardly Art in October 2013.\n"
