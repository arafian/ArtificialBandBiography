      "Screw 32 is an American, Berkeley/East Bay-area, punk rock band.\n",
      "Their name has many supposed origins, the most popular states that it is derived from an anti-skateboarding measure on the ballots in Concord, California. They were noted for self-publicity. For example, they ordered stickers by the thousands and stuck them in numerous places. They were also known to \"tag\" their name with sharpies on numerous objects and in numerous places; the results of which have been seen in places all over the country. Most of these incidents are apparently done without permission. One notable sighting was on the Grassy Knoll near where Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated President John F. Kennedy. These stickers have also been seen on bumpers of police cars all over the Bay Area.\n",
      "The band's vocalist is Andrew \"Andrew Champion\" Ataie, who went on to a variety of bands like Hopelifter, End of the World, Shadowboxer, and Highwire Days. Guitarist Doug Sangalang went on to the bands Limp, One Time Angels, and Jackson United. Bass player Jimi Cheetah went on to the bands Tilt and Nothing Cool, as well as running Cheetah's Records. Guitarist Grant McIntire and drummer Mark Mortenson went on to a brief stint in Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. Mark Mortenson also played in the bands Grinch and Samiam. Grant McIntire and Andrew Champion also played in the band Dance Hall Crashers.\n"
