            "In 1985, the band formed in Skövde, Sweden as Kingpin[2] with the lineup of local musicians Tim Skold (going by \"Tim Tim\") (bass), Harry K. Cody (guitar) and Pekka \"Stixx Galore\" (later simply \"Stixx\") Ollinen (drums), and original singer J.K. Knox (Jukka Kemppainen). The band recorded the album Welcome To Bop City released by CMM Records in 1988, which yielded a No. 1 single in Sweden called \"Shout It Out.\"[3] In the US, the song rose to the top 100 of the Billboard Album Chart.[4]\nDuring the recording of Welcome To Bop City, Knox was replaced by Easy Action singer Zinny J. Zan (vocals), after the latter auditioned.[5]\n",
            "The band secured a record deal with Relativity Records. They discovered that a San Francisco band had a copyright on the name Kingpin, so when the group relocated to Hollywood, California, they changed their name to Shotgun Messiah.[6] The band remixed Welcome To Bop City and it was released in September 1989 as Shotgun Messiah.[6] Shotgun Messiah embarked on their first North American solo tour to support the album.\n",
