   "rawData": [
      "Stone the Crows was a blues-rock band formed in Glasgow in late 1969. They are primarily remembered for the onstage electrocution of guitarist and founding member Les Harvey.\n",
      "The band were formed after Maggie Bell was introduced to Les Harvey by his elder brother Alex Harvey. After playing together in the Kinning Park Ramblers, their next band Power was renamed Stone the Crows (after a British/Australian English exclamation of surprise or shock) by Led Zeppelin's manager, Peter Grant.  The band was co-managed by Grant and Mark London. London was associated with Lulu as the co-writer of her signature song, \"To Sir With Love\" and was also married to Lulu's manager, Marion Massey. London had also managed the predecessor band Cartoone, in which Peter Grant had a financial interest and featured Les Harvey on guitar.\n",
      "The band's first two albums were recorded with the original line up and Bell's vocals were described as being similar to Janis Joplin's.\n"
