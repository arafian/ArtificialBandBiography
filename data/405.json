         "The Brothers Martin are an indie rock band from Riverside, California consisting of brothers Ronnie Martin and Jason Martin.[1] Musically, they incorporate elements of both Joy Electric and Starflyer 59 (Ronnie and Jason's primary music projects, respectively): electropop and shoegazing,[2][3] while modern rock and 1980s new wave are also a central influence.\n",
         "As of November 2008, the band was dropped from the \"Current Artists\" section of the Tooth & Nail website. While there has never been any word from the Martin brothers, it is assumed that The Brothers Martin was a one-time project.\n"
