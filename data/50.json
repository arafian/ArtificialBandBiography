         "Butch Engle formed The Showmen—not to be confused with the 1960s pop group of the same name— in 1963 after he took over and renamed an earlier incarnation of the band, whose roster had included Bill Champlin.[1] \nThe group consisted of Engle, guitarist Bob Zamora, organist Mike Pardee, bassist Harry \"Happiness\" Smith, and drummer Rich Morrison.[2] \nIn 1964 the Showmen released the British Invasion-influenced single \"You Know All I Want\".[1] \nThe band changed their name in 1965 to Butch Engle & the Styx.[3] \nWith the exception of their debut single, all material recorded by the band was written or co-written by Ron Elliott of The Beau Brummels.[3] \nAccording to Engle, \"Ron, Sly Stewart [later known as Sly Stone], [and Autumn Records executives] Tom Donahue and Bobby Mitchell would choose which songs would go on [a Beau Brummels] album, and then we could take what we wanted from whatever was left\".[4] \nButch Engle & the Styx released a single, \"I'm a Girl\", in 1966 on the Warner Bros. Records subsidiary, Loma Records.[2] \nThe band shortened their name to The Styx and released another single, \"Hey, I'm Lost\", in 1967,[5] \nbefore breaking up the following year.[4] \nIn 2000, Sundazed Records released No Matter What You Say: The Best of Butch Engle & the Styx, a compilation album which contained the band's three singles—including B-sides—along with 11 previously unreleased recordings.[6] \n\"Hey, I'm Lost\" appeared on the 2007 Love Is the Song We Sing: San Francisco Nuggets 1965–1970 box set.[7]\n"

         "Author and music journalist Richie Unterberger noted the two songs that comprised the band's first single were \"performed rather sloppily\",[1] and called the Elliott-composed material \"weak by Elliott's own high standards and in fact were basically leftovers that were not deemed strong enough for the Beau Brummels to record\". Unterberger said Butch Engle & the Styx were \"lesser musicians and singers than the Beau Brummels, too\".[6] He named \"Hey, I'm Lost\" as the band's highlight, describing the song as \"a charging, slightly ominous and doubtful number with good vocal harmonies.[6]\n"
