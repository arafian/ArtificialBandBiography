Their highest-charting single is \"Callin' Baton Rouge\", which peaked at No. 37 on the U.S. country charts in 1989 and was a Top 5 country hit for Garth Brooks five years later.\n",
      "In 2020, the group were inducted into the Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame.\n",
      "The origins of New Grass Revival lay in the Bluegrass Alliance, which Sam Bush (vocals, fiddle, guitar, mandolin) and Courtney Johnson (banjo, vocals) joined in 1970. At the time, the Alliance also featured bassist Ebo Walker and fiddler Lonnie Peerce. Within a year after Bush's and Johnson's arrival, Curtis Burch (dobro, guitar, vocals) joined the band. In 1972, Peerce left the band, and the remaining members decided to continue under the new name New Grass Revival. The band released their eponymous debut album The Arrival of the New Grass Revival later in 1972 on Starday Records.\n"
