Their second album, Brooklyn, was mixed by Andy Haller and released in 2007, followed by a live album in 2008. Eli Marcus later went on to become a solo artist with his debut studio album \"Dovid HaMelech\" released in 2015.\n",

         "8th Day's sound, though primarily inspired by traditional Jewish music, also contains influences from secular styles such as power pop, blues, and reggae.[4] Guitarist Bentzion Marcus has described the group as a \"very eclectic, klezmer-funk-rock band\", noting that on Chasing Prophecy, \"each song stands on its own. The style of songs range from Middle Eastern, rock, folk/country, jazz/blues. It’s got everything.\"[1]\n"
