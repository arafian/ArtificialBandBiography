Under the stage name Ukigmo (浮雲, Ukigumo, \"drifting cloud\"), he was the second guitarist for Ringo Sheena's band Tokyo Jihen from 2005 until 2012. In 2013, Nagoka joined the band Gokumontō Ikka, a new project for Queen Bee leader Avu-chan.\n",
      "He was born and raised in public housing in Chiba Prefecture. The first instrument he learned during his childhood was the piano, which he started learning at age 9. He was introduced to bluegrass music at an early age, as his father was an amateur bluegrass musician. He started playing the guitar as a junior in high school, and joined a country band. He is an avid motorcycle and French car aficionado.\n",
      "Nagaoka is an old friend of Shiina Ringo's, and he had played in a band with her elder brother Shiina Junpei, Evil Vibrations. He also participated in the recording of her third solo album, Kalk, Samen, Chestnut Flower, on which he played guitar on the songs \"Camouflage\" (迷彩, Meisai), \"Consciously\" (意識, Ishiki) and the vinyl record bonus track \"Fig Flower\" (映日紅の花, Ichijiku no Hana, which he also arranged and composed), as well as being credited on vacuum cleaner and \"vocal percussion\" on two more songs. After the departure of Mikio Hirama from Sheena's band, Tokyo Jihen, he became the band's guitarist and background vocalist in 2005 after writing the song \"Fig Flower,\" which was only released on vinyl. Upon joining the band's \"Phase 2\", he was given the pseudonym Ukigumo by Sheena. With them, he released four albums and a mini-album, and he remained with the band until its 2012 breakup. He has penned numerous songs as a member of the band, including the single \"OSCA\", and was also the lead arranger for the single \"Shuraba\".\n"
