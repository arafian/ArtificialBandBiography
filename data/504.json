      "Formed in 1998 under the name Letter Twelve, the group signed to Tooth & Nail Records in 2004 and changed its name. The band's first, and only, release under this name was entitled How the Lonely Keep, and in 2005 they went on tour with labelmates Anberlin. The record hit No. 39 on the Billboard Top Christian Albums chart in 2005. Matthew Tsai of Absolute Punk called the record \"one of the great emo releases of the 00's\". Melodic.net compared the group to Anberlin, Jimmy Eat World and Third Eye Blind.\n",
      "Shortly after the release of the album, all of the band's members except for lead singer Travis Bryant departed the group during their tour with The Spill Canvas and Rufio; Bryant toured with Terminal as a solo act for the remainder of the tour. Bryant found replacements for the members later in 2005 and continued to tour behind the album, touring with Saosin, He Is Legend, The Juliana Theory, Cartel, The Working Title, Codeseven, The Receiving End of Sirens, and Yesterdays Rising. Terminal split in January 2006.\n"
