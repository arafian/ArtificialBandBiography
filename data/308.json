         "The band formed in 1991 near Surrey.[1] and were commonly known as the acronym B.N.U. in the early years, as a band name logo was needed to post on a playbill.  They started by playing locally in Vancouver.[2]\n",
         "They were featured on Thrasher Skate Rock Vol. 11 and in 1992 they were winners of CITR-FM's 1882 SHiNDiG live performance contest, which awarded them some studio time.[3][4]\n",
         "By 1998 the band had released several singles and EPs. Influences of 7 Seconds and Dag Nasty can be heard in early recordings on the Three Minute Mile 7inch with original drummer Garnet Kulhavy, while later recordings feature a more post-hardcore feel with hard hitting live elements. Some of these tracks were collected and released through BYO Records as the album Looking Back Again.[5]\n",
         "In 1998 the band released the album Diddly Squat through the Creative Man label.[6] With CD and Vinyl releases on HeartFirst Records, BYO Records, and Burning Heart Records, the band disbanded in 2000.\n",
         "In February, 2010, the band played a reunion show in Vancouver.[7] The band's latest lineup was singer Gary Lavallee, guitarist Jinx Stringer, bassist Ben Hughes, and drummer Gabe Mantle.\n"
