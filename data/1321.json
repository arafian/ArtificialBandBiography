      "\nThe Burial were an English Oi! band that incorporated ska, northern soul and folk influences into their music. Formed in 1981 in Yorkshire, England, they released one album, A Day On the Town, in 1988, and worked with Bradford's anarchist rant-poet Nick Toczek on various projects under the name Britanarchists. They disbanded in 1988.\n",
      "Two of The Burial's earliest recordings, \"Backstreet Child\" and \"I Just Can't Forget\", appear on the compilation album Oi! The Demos (80-83), whose liner notes describe them as \"the prototype Skacore band\". They have three songs on the compilation Oi! of Sex — two as The Burial (\"Old Mans Poison\", \"Friday Night\") and one as Nick Toczek's Britanarchists (\"Stiff With a Quiff\"). Their song \"Sheila\" appears on the compilation The Sound of Oi!, and their song \"Holding On\" appears on  Oi! Glorious Oi!\n",
      "Their sound is described in Spirit of '69: A Skinhead Bible as a \"volatile Punk and Soul cocktail.\" In his article \"Oi!: The Truth\", Garry Bushell wrote: \"Scarborough’s Burial cited Oi and 2-Tone as forebears and mixed the sounds of ska and rowdy bootboy punk in their set.\"  A song by Bushell's band The Gonads, \"Joys of Oi!\", included the lyric \"Burial at number one\". i-D magazine stated The Burial are \"probably the first skinhead band to ever play ska\". The Burial are described in Burning Britain: The History of UK Punk 1980–1984 as \"Skinhead Ska\". The band were regularly featured in the traditional skinhead fanzine Hard as Nails, and were described in Issue 4 as \"Great Streetpunk hopes\".\n"
