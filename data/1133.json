      "Initially the band was founded by guitarist Mark Knight and bassist Kyle Kyle in 1988. Knight wanted a second guitarist and recruited Kyle Stevens. At the suggestion of Rough Cutt's Amir Derakh, vocalist Joe Leste' joined the band as its frontman which led to Leste's childhood friend, Tigg Ketler, completing the 5 piece line up as Bang Tango's drummer.\n",
