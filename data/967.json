         "In 1999, the band worked with producer/engineer Eddie Kramer to independently release their debut album, More Than It Would Seem.[2] Upon graduation from the University of Miami, they relocated to New York City and were signed to Reprise by David Kahne. They released their major label debut, On a Rolling Ball, in 2002. Three years later, they released the Live at World Cafe EP, which featured the song \"All Will Be Well,\" which was featured in promos for the NBC show Conviction.\n",
         "Prior to the release of On a Rolling Ball, Dixon played keyboards and sang backing vocals on Paul McCartney's 2001 album, \"Driving Rain.\" Dixon also performed live with McCartney at the Concert For New York City, a September 11 fundraiser. McCartney offered Dixon the opportunity to join his world tour, but Dixon declined the position to focus on the production of On a Rolling Ball.\n",
         "The band played piano-driven rock akin to Ben Folds Five, albeit with a more serious tone. Billy Joel, Jackson Browne and early Elton John influenced the band's stylized vocal and piano rhythms.\n",
         "Following the Live at World Cafe EP, the band signed with Fantasy Records and released The Gabe Dixon Band,  in August 2008. In its initial days of release, it received praise from the music press and fellow artists.[citation needed] The band toured the United States from Aug 2008 through Nov 2008 with native New Yorker turned Canadian resident, newcomer Justin Nozuka.[3]\n",
         "Several tracks from the album received moderate media attention. \"Find My Way\" was the opening track to the film The Proposal (2009) starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. \"All Will Be Well\" was featured in the fourth season of the television show Parks and Recreation. And \"Till You're Gone\" was used in Bose store displays.\n"
