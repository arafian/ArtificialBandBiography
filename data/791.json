      "Gardenian is a Swedish melodic death metal band from Gothenburg. It formed in 1996 and disbanded in 2004 but reunited in 2012.\n",
      "Gardenian was formed in April 1996 by drummer Thim Blom and vocalist/guitarist Jim Kjell. Eventually, guitarist Niklas Engelin and bassist Håkan Skoger joined the band. Later in 1996, the band recorded a demo and sent it to Listenable Records who gave the band a record deal and booked Studio Fredman that same year so that the band could record their debut studio album.\n",
      "In 1997, Gardenian released their debut studio album, Two Feet Stand. After the album's release, the band was pretty dormant due to lack of interest by their label Listenable Records. At this point Niklas Engelin decided to join In Flames for some tours. However, eventually the band decided they needed to break off their contract with Listenable Records and dedicate themselves fully to the band, something which bassist Håkan Skoger felt he could no longer do since he wanted to focus on his other band Headplate.\n"
