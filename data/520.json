         "The band were formed after Maggie Bell was introduced to Les Harvey by his elder brother Alex Harvey.[1] After playing together in the Kinning Park Ramblers, their next band Power was renamed Stone the Crows (after a British/Australian English exclamation of surprise or shock) by Led Zeppelin's manager, Peter Grant.[2]  The band was co-managed by Grant and Mark London. London was associated with Lulu as the co-writer of her signature song, \"To Sir With Love\" and was also married to Lulu's manager, Marion Massey. London had also managed the predecessor band Cartoone, in which Peter Grant had a financial interest and featured Les Harvey on guitar.[3]\n"

         "Guitarist and co-founder Les Harvey was electrocuted onstage in front of a live audience at Swansea's Top Rank Suite in May 1972. Wires to the group's equipment were reportedly damaged by the audience and although the road crew attempted to repair the damage, they overlooked a loose ground wire.[5] Harvey received a jolt of electricity as he reached for a microphone while his fingers touched the metal strings on his guitar. His body reportedly flew into the air and came to rest with his guitar in contact with the microphone stand. Bandmates who tried to rescue him reportedly got shocked themselves and it wasn't until someone kicked his guitar away[6] that medical personnel were able to render aid. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.\n",
         "Jimmy McCulloch would subsequently replace the main songwriter Harvey as lead guitarist, following Harvey's death.[1] After Harvey's death the band reconsidered their direction.[7]\n"

      "text": [
         "Stone the Crows ultimately broke up in June 1973,[1] and Peter Grant continued to manage Maggie Bell's career. Guided by Grant, Bell subsequently recorded two solo albums, Queen of the Night (1974) and Suicide Sal (1975) and an album with the Grant-managed band Midnight Flyer (1981). Bell is also known for her session work on Rod Stewart's album Every Picture Tells a Story (1971), in particular her co-lead vocal with Stewart on the album's title track (credited as \"vocal abrasives\").[8]  Jimmy McCulloch joined Paul McCartney's group Wings, in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1974.\n"
