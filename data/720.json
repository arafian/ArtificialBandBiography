      "Curse of Lono is an English alternative rock band based in London and signed to Submarine Cat Records. They have released one EP and two studio albums. Their most recent album, As I Fell, peaked at number 10 on the Official Americana Albums Chart and at number 15 on the Official Independent Album Breakers Chart in the U.K. The band has also been the subject of two short films, Saturday Night: A Film Of Four Songs and Somewhere In Their Heads, both of which have won awards and appeared at numerous film festivals.\n",
      "After the dissolution of their band, Hey Negrita, Felix Bechtolsheimer (lead vocals and guitar) and Neil Findlay (drums) formed Curse of Lono in 2015. The band's name comes from the title of Hunter S. Thompson's 1983 book, The Curse of Lono. Bechtolsheimer and Findlay soon added Joe Hazell (lead guitar), Dani Ruiz Hernandez (keyboards), and Charis Anderson (bass - ex Poussez Posse) to round out the group. They released their debut eponymous EP in October 2016 through Submarine Cat Records. The collection was produced by Oli Bayston. In support of the EP, the band went on a European tour with Uncle Lucius. Interconnected music videos for the EP's four songs were compiled in a short film called, Saturday Night: A Film Of Four Songs, which was released in conjunction with the EP. The film would go on to appear in numerous film festivals and win the Best Music Video awards for both the Los Angeles Independent Film Festival and the London Independent Film Festival.\n",
      "In February 2017, the band premiered their lead single, \"Pick Up The Pieces,\" off their debut studio album, Severed. That album was released in April 2017. That year, the band played sold-out shows in various London venues including The Islington, Servant Jazz Quarters, and The Water Rats. The proceeds from the latter show were donated to the cancer fund of the late Barry Marshall-Everitt, a prominent London music figure. The band also played a number of UK music festivals in 2017, including the Isle of Wight Festival, Standon Calling, Wychwood Festival, and others. Later in the year, Curse of Lono went on a European tour with Chuck Prophet and The Mission Express and a smaller UK tour with Low Cut Connie.\n"
