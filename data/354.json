            "In 1967, Ra McGuire and Brian Smith played in a band called Winter's Green, which recorded two songs, \"Are You a Monkey\" and \"Jump in the River Blues\", on the Rumble Records Label. \"Are You a Monkey\" later appeared on a rock collection: 1983's \"The History of Vancouver Rock and Roll, Vol. 3\".[1]\n",
            "In the early seventies, Winter's Green changed their name to Applejack and added drummer Tommy Stewart and bassist Harry Kalensky to their lineup. Applejack became a very popular band in the Vancouver area, and began touring extensively in British Columbia. The band played a few original tunes such as \"Raise a Little Hell\" and \"Oh, Pretty Lady\", as well as Top 40 songs by artists such as Neil Young and Chicago.\n",
            "After hearing Applejack perform, Randy Bachman of Bachman–Turner Overdrive and The Guess Who signed the band to his \"Legend\" label. The band changed their name to Trooper, and Bachman produced the band's self-titled debut album, Trooper, which contained the Canadian hits \"Baby Woncha Please Come Home\" and \"General Hand Grenade\". Managed by Sam Feldman,[2] Trooper began touring extensively in both Canada and the United States.\n",
            "After moving from Legend Records to MCA Records, Trooper added Frank Ludwig on keyboards. Their 1975 debut album was followed by Two for the Show in 1976, which was certified Gold in Canada. The album contained the hits \"Two for the Show\", and \"Santa Maria\". The latter of the two hits was inspired from a trip by boat to Tugwell Island, near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.\n",
            "Bassist Harry Kalensky was replaced by Doni Underhill before the recording of Trooper's third studio album. Knock 'Em Dead Kid, was released in 1977 and became the group's first Canadian Platinum record. This album contained the hits \"We're Here for a Good Time (Not a Long Time)\", and \"Oh, Pretty Lady\".\n",
            "In 1978, Thick as Thieves went double-platinum and featured the group's only successful U.S. single,[3] \"Raise A Little Hell\". This album also contained the hits \"Round, Round We Go\" and \"The Moment That It Takes\", both of which were sung by keyboardist Frank Ludwig.\n",
            "Trooper's fifth studio album, Flying Colors, was released in 1979, and contained the hits \"Three Dressed Up as a Nine\", and the band's highest-charting single to date, \"Janine\", which pushed the album to attain Double-Platinum status.\n",
            "The band's 1979 album, Hot Shots, broke all records for Canadian sales of a Canadian album, reaching Quadruple-Platinum status. Hot Shots was a greatest hits album containing remixes of all of the most popular songs from Trooper's first five studio albums.[4] \"The Boys in the Bright White Sports Car\" (originally released on Two for the Show in 1976), became a hit single upon the release of Hot Shots.\n"

            "In April of 1980, Trooper was honoured with a Juno Award for \"Group of the Year\".[5]  Two of their albums (Hot Shots and Flying Colors, both released in 1979) were also nominated that year for \"Album of the Year\".\n",
            "In 1980, Trooper severed their artist–producer relationship with Randy Bachman.\n",
            "Also in 1980, Frank Ludwig was replaced by Rob Deans, who performed on the next two albums: Trooper's self-produced seventh album Untitled, released in October 1980, and Money Talks which was released in 1982 and produced by Heart producer Mike Flicker and released on the RCA Label.[6]\n",
            "In 1986, Trooper was without a permanent keyboardist, and Frank Ludwig re-joined the band as a temporary replacement on their summer tour.\n",
            "The Last of the Gypsies was released in 1989 on the band's self-owned Great Pacific Records label and distributed by Warner Music Canada. This was Trooper's first studio album in six years, and was certified Canadian Gold. It appeared on the RPM Top 100 Albums chart that year.[7] It contained the hits \"Boy With the Beat\", and \"The Best Way (to Hold A Man)\".\n"

The totally updated and re-mastered collection featured songs spanning the entirety of their recording career. John Kereiff of Gonzo Magazine called it \"THE summer album of 2010.\" [10] Universal Music's official Press Release named Trooper as \"one of Canada's top five selling bands of all time\".\n",
            "On August 11, 2010, the members of Trooper enjoyed a private tour of the Gatineau Preservation Centre to see where Library and Archives Canada houses its collected Trooper archives. The Trooper archives consist of 401 photographs and a stack of textual records such as financial records, which McGuire and Smith donated in 2004, hoping to provide some insight to the Canadian music industry of the '70s and '80s.  McGuire, \"now 60, bald, and bespectacled\" had a chance to laugh when he read aloud from an old Toronto Sun clipping among the collection which described McGuire as \"a new teen idol.\" The band later made another donation to the archive, including some of their early demo recordings, lyrics sheets, and master tapes.[11]\n",
            "The band has also donated the massive 32-foot sign bearing Trooper's logo, complete with strobe-lit stars once used to illuminate their shows, to the Canadian Museum of Civilization.[11]\n",
            "Trooper's visit to the archive was covered by almost every major newspaper in Canada.[11][12][13][14]\n",
            "In 2012, Ra McGuire and Brian Smith were presented with the SOCAN National Achievement Award, which is presented to members who have had outstanding success, predominantly in the Canadian music industry, over the span of their career.
