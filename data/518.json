         "Blossom Toes were a British psychedelic pop band active between 1966 and 1970. Initially known as The Ingoes,[1] they were renamed and signed to the Marmalade record label of manager Giorgio Gomelsky.[2] The original line-up comprised Brian Godding (born 19 August 1945, Monmouth, South Wales) (guitar, vocals, keyboards), Jim Cregan (born James Cregan, 9 March 1946, Yeovil, Somerset) (guitar, vocals), Brian Belshaw (born 25 February 1944, Wigan, Lancashire) (bass, vocals), and Kevin Westlake (born Kevin Patrick Westlake, 5 March 1947, Dublin, Co Dublin, Ireland (drums).[1][3]\n",
         "The band's debut album, We Are Ever So Clean is a classic example of quintessentially English psychedelia. On release, it was presented in the UK music magazine Melody Maker as \"Giorgio Gomelsky's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". Although not a major commercial success, tracks such as \"What On Earth\" or \"Look At Me, I'm You\" have helped give the album something of a cult period status as it is unearthed by successive generations of 1960s retro fans. It was included in Record Collector's list of the \"100 Greatest Psychedelic Records\".[4]\n",

         "The band quit in 1970.[1] Belshaw and Godding rejoined Westlake in B.B. Blunder,[1] Cregan formed Stud with John Wilson and Charlie McCracken,[1] before joining Family, as did Palmer.[2]\n",
