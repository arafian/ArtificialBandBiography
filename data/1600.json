      "Marea are a Spanish rock band from Berriozar, Navarre formed in 1997 by Kutxi Romero. So far they have released six studio albums, a collection boxset and a live record.\n",
      "In 1997, after having been a member of 9 different punk bands, Kutxi Romero decided to form a rock group.\n",
      "He called Alen Ayerdi - former drummer of Begira - who didn't hesitate to join Kutxi's project. He then contacted Edu Beaumont \"Piñas\", whom he had met one year before. Piñas hadn't played previously in any other band, but Kutxi - who was a very good friend of his - persuaded him to join as bassist. Piñas accepted and introduced Kutxi to César Ramallo, who would become one of Marea's guitarists. David Díaz, aka Kolibrí, also a guitarist, also joined the band.\n"
