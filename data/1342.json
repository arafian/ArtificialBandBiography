         "The band signed to the Workers Playtime label and their first release was the Not Listening Anymore EP, which received regular airplay from BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel, and reached number nine in the UK Independent Chart.[2] Their first album was named Snuff Said, but the full album name was Snuffsaidbutgorblimeyguvstonemeifhedidn'tthrowawobblerchachachachachachachachachachachayou'regoinghomeinacosmicambience, which started their habit of playing on their supposed Cockney roots. The album peaked at number three on the UK Indie Chart.[2]\n",
         "Following up from their first album was the 'mini-album' Flibbiddydibbiddydob, featuring mainly cover versions and TV commercial jingles reworked by the band. The release was the subject of a disagreement with the British Phonographic Industry (BPI); Snuff maintained it was an EP, and as such should be eligible for the UK Singles Chart, but the BPI insisted on classifying it as an album because of the large number of tracks.\n",
         "In 1991, Snuff split up.[1] During this period all three members applied to be the bassist for Leatherface. The break-up also spawned Guns n' Wankers and Your Mum in 93-94 and who's line up included simon wells, Loz Wong, Rory Blaney, Paul McMahon and Tony Poole.\n",
         "Following a reformation of the original line-up in 1994, along with permanent Hammond and trombone, Simon Wells left the band and was replaced by Loz Wong who had played in Guns n' Wankers with Simon. A while later Andy Crighton was replaced by Lee Erinmez (n√©e Batsford) on bass. They released a Christmas single, the theme to \"Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?\".[1] Steve Lamacq has also featured Snuff on his radio show. Simon Wells has since formed the band, Southport, and has played occasionally with Duncan under the name Footballer's Wives.\n",
         "In 2005, Snuff released a greatest hits double album. Also in 2005, Duncan Redmonds released a self-titled solo project CD Billy No Mates, and at live shows his solo material is combined with some Snuff and Guns n' Wankers songs. Billy No Mates have two touring bands, one in Japan and one in the UK, and Redmonds has recorded different EP's with each band.\n",
         "In 2006 a new band called Pot Kettle Black formed. This featured Redmonds on drums, Wells on guitar, and Wes Wasley completing the trio on bass. The line-up played a mixture of old Snuff songs (generally up until Demmamussabebonk), and new material in the same vein. The project was pronounced 'dead' by Redmonds on the 10 Past 12 Records website guestbook in August 2007. Since then, Redmonds has played a series of gigs in Japan with Duncan's Divas, and embarked on solo acoustic gigs in the UK.\n",
         "In 2008, a brief tour of Japan was announced, featuring gigs in Tokyo.[3] Following this, the band continued to gig in 2009, supporting NOFX in Birmingham and London on their UK tour, and played both the Reading and Leeds Festivals.\n"

Notably, the album also included a new track recorded by Guns N Wankers, the first since bassist Jools Parkin suffered a brain haemorrhage.\n"

         "The band undertook another short tour of Japan in 2011, as well as the recording and release of a tour EP, entitled 5-4-3-2-1 Ding-a-Ling Yahon, which consisted of new songs and Japanese covers.\n",
         "In spring 2012, the band took to the road for a 10-date UK tour, with Oliver Stewart taking over trombone duties from Dave Redmonds.
