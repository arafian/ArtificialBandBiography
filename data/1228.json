      "Low vs Diamond was an American rock band formed in 2002 by Lucas Field, Howie Diamond, and Tad Moore (birth name: James Thaddeus Moore IV) while they were students at the University of Colorado.  Following graduation, they relocated to Los Angeles, where they met up with the other two members of the band, Anthony Polcino and Jon Pancoast.  Low vs Diamond released their debut EP, Life After Love, in February 2007, and their self-titled debut album in April 2008.\n",
      "Singer/guitarist Lucas Field, drummer Howie Diamond, and keyboardist Tad Moore were undergrads at the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2001 when they began to play together in a jam band. Diamond graduated in September of '01 and moved to Los Angeles prior to Moore beginning at CU in the fall of 2001 where he met Field. Outside of typical jam band influences such as Dave Matthews and Phish, the group were influenced by a diversity of artists, including David Bowie, Roxy Music, Brian Eno, Serge Gainsbourg, and Air.  After graduation, the group relocated to Los Angeles, where their band began to explore a more indie rock sound.\n",
      "They went through various bandmember and name changes (including 1984 and Colored Shadows) before deciding on Low vs Diamond.  The name supposedly refers to Howie Diamond's fighting with ex-member Ben Pollock's girlfriend, Lo (the couple later went on to form synthpunk group Hearts Revolution).  Two bandmembers, Anthony Polcino (guitar/vocals) and Jon Pancoast (bass), eventually completed the band's line-up.  The quintet played gigs all over Los Angeles, where they prepared material to record in the studio.\n"
