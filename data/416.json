      "Crumbächer was an American Christian new wave, synthpop and dance-pop band in the 1980s, headed by Stephen Crumbächer.\n",
      "After five years of friendship, Stephen Crumbächer, Dawn Wisner and Jim Wisner played their first performance as Crumbächer at a New Year's Eve show in 1983. The following summer, the band entered the studio for the first time to begin recording a six-song EP for Calvary Chapel's MRC label with Ojo Taylor of Undercover producing and Derri Daugherty of The Choir engineering. Once the label heard the early results, they requested that the band record a few additional songs so that it could be released as a full-length album, instead of an EP. The album, Incandescent, was released in April 1985 on Broken Records, which was classified as a new wave material.\n",
      "The band signed with the newly formed Frontline Records and began work on their second album, the self-produced Escape from the Fallen Planet which was released in 1986. The following year, after New Wave had died down, the band made the transition to dance-pop where they returned with Thunder Beach, produced by Bill Baumgart, and in 1988, the band recorded their final album together entitled, Tame the Volcano.\n"
