      "The Neon Boys were a short lived New York City proto-punk band, composed of Tom Verlaine, Richard Hell and Billy Ficca. The trio later went on to form the influential rock band Television in 1973; Richard Hell also went on to form the influential punk bands the Heartbreakers and Richard Hell and the Voidoids.\n",
      "Two Neon Boys' recordings, \"That's All I Know (Right Now)\" and \"Love Comes In Spurts,\" were released by Shake Records on a 1980 EP, backed with two songs by Richard Hell and the Voidoids. The same songs were re-released in 1991 by Overground Records with the addition of one more Neon Boys song, \"High Heeled Wheels.\"\n",
      "Information about the Neon Boys includes oral histories, newspaper and magazine articles, and narratives written by the band members themselves. As such, there may be some discrepancies in issues like band formation dates and songs recorded. For example, according to The A to Z of Alternative Music, only two songs were recorded by the Neon Boys. This is contradicted by Genius that lists four songs. The fact that the band never performed a live show adds to the confusion.\n"
