      "Voodoo Glow Skulls are an American ska punk band formed in 1988 in Riverside, California, United States, by brothers Frank, Eddie, and Jorge Casillas and their longtime friend Jerry O'Neill. Voodoo Glow Skulls first played at backyard parties and later at Spanky's Café in their hometown of Riverside, where they played shows with the Angry Samoans, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Firehose, Murphy's Law, and The Dickies.\n",
      "Their first recording was in 1989 –  a four-song demo on a four-track machine which they duplicated onto about sixty cassettes on a home stereo then sold at shows.\n",
      "In 1990, Voodoo Glow Skulls released their first 7\" EP The Old of Tomorrow, a parody title inspired by the straight edge band named Youth of Today, with the help of local band Public Humiliation, and also booked their own DIY US tour.\n"
