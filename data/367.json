         "Immaculate Machine was a trio in 2003 consisting of Brooke Gallupe, Kathryn Calder and Luke Kozlowski.  The band released The View and Transporter independently before signing to label Mint Records in early 2005.\n",
         "Their Mint Records debut, Ones and Zeros, came out on September 6, 2005, and they supported the album with a tour of Canada and the United States. That year, Calder became a member of The New Pornographers, appearing on the album Twin Cinema and touring with the band. She is the niece of New Pornographers leader A.C. Newman.[2]\n",
         "In early June 2007, the band's song \"Jarhand\", the first single from their third album Immaculate Machine's Fables, was featured as the iTunes free single of the week.\n",
         "In 2009, Kozlowski left the band and was replaced by Aden Collinge. \nAs well, due to family commitments, Calder was unable to tour the band's latest album, High on Jackson Hill. To compensate for this, a touring band was formed consisting of Caitlin Gallupe, Brooke's sister, Jordan Minkoff, bandmate of Caitlin in Slam Dunk, and occasionally Leslie Rewega.\n"
