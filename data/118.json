         "Pfeiffer began working on music under the name Vernian Process in the winter of 2003. He released a number of downloadable albums over the next 4 years, including 2004's Discovery and  2006's The Forgotten Age, before being approached by Irigoyen about joining forces to work on Behold the Machine.  From that point forward, Vernian Process evolved beyond a solo project.  Throughout 2009, as work on the album progressed, Vernian Process sought out additional members in order to play shows to support the upcoming release of Behold the Machine, as well as record new material for future albums.
