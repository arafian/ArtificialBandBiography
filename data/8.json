      "Flowerhead was a rock band from Austin, Texas.\n",
      "The seeds of Flowerhead were originally planted deep underground by founding members Eric Faust (Lead Vocals, Bass, Guitars) and Buz Zoller (Guitars, Vocals) in 1987. With the addition of Eric Schmitz (Guitars, Vocals) in 1989 and Pete Levine (Drums, Vocals) in 1990, the roots took hold. The unassuming rock band, working in the sweaty club environments of Austin, Texas and nearby cities and states, began its campaign to enter the music world with their independently produced 4-track, cassette only release \"Turmoil in the Toybox\". \n",
      "After being \"discovered\" (buying and listening to Turmoil) by CMJ (College Media Journal) veteran Scott Byron (A&R guru for BMG label Zoo Entertainment), the band was quickly signed following feverish live performances preceding and during Austin's popular South by Southwest Music Festival. A fast paced 1991 resulted in the rapid replacement of local management and legal representation by industry insiders in New York City and Hollywood. Riding on the \"Turmoil Tapes\", the band embarked on a promotional tour before going into the studio. An East coast stint with British rockers Thee Hypnotics laid a foundation in the \"cool club circuit\" that made Flowerhead welcome throughout the U.S. and Canada.\n"
