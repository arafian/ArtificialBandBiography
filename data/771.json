   "rawData": [
      "Endgames was a Scottish pop band, having some success in the 1980s, due to songs such as \"First-Last-For Everything,\" \"Waiting for Another Chance,\" \"Ecstasy,\" and \"Desire.\" Not recognized among the bands of their day, they are still a charming reminder of the New Wave era.\n",
      "Endgames was formed in Glasgow, Scotland by David Rudden and David Murdoch.\n",
      "The band began through gigging at clubs and colleges in Glasgow, Scotland, and eventually appeared as a support act for the band Simple Minds in late December 1979, for which they received a rather lukewarm mention at the \"New Musical Express\" (\"Pleasant rather disturbing, End Game  have some good, if half-formed ideas... but at least they don't sound like the Berlin Blondes\").\n"
