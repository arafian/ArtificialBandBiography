      "Fred Butson and Gabe Johannes joined on with Nate Lamb (lead guitar), Kevin Hall (rhythm guitar), and Chip Bos (friend who was also sound guy at the time) and helped start the group Bliss, which was later renamed 'Sevenglory'.

Butson and Gabe Johannes lived in the same suite at Indiana Wesleyan University. Original lead guitarist Nathan Lamb left after several years to start a career in Colorado. Gabe's brother Caleb joined the group after the group's original bassist, Kyle Inman, left to pursue a career as a Technical Director at Kensington Community Church in Michigan.

Josh Parsons (Lead Guitar) joined the band a couple years later.   In 2010, Butson and Parsons felt it was time to move on, which left Sevenglory looking not only for a lead singer but a lead guitar player as well.\n",
