         "Tarentel is a band based in San Francisco, California, which formed in 1995. Initially, the band consisted of Danny Grody and Jefre Cantu-Ledesma. The line-up altered over the years and has included John Hughes, Trevor Montgomery, Patricia Kavanaugh, Kenseth Thibideau, Jeffrey Rosenberg, Jim Redd, Tony Cross, Steve Dye and others.\n",
         "The band's current[when?] lineup is Cantu-Ledesma, Grody and Jim Redd.\n",
         "Tarentel began as a post-rock band, making extended, LP-side length instrumental pieces. Over the course of three full-length albums and a number of singles and EPs, Tarentel has gradually shifted its style to a looser, more improvisational form that incorporates genres such as noise and drone as well as having a strong psychedelic element.\n",
         "Tarentel member, Paul Clipson, projects original Super-8 film compositions that accompany each live performance by the band. He died in February 2018.[1]\n",
         "The band released no new material in 2010, and in the spring of 2011 Cantu-Ledesma moved from San Francisco—the band's home base—to Germany, leaving the status of the band in doubt, although likely indicating a breakup.\n"
