      "Ghost Light is a five-piece American jam band formed in 2017 by Tom Hamilton, Raina Mullen, Holly Bowling, Scotty Zwang and Dan Africano. \nGhost Light's debut album, \"Best Kept Secret,\" was named one of Glide's top 20 albums of 2019. Ghost Light has performed on major festival stages and in historic venues including Lockn' Festival, Jam Cruise, Electric Forest Festival, Mission Ballroom, Brooklyn Bowl, The Peach Music Festival and Terrapin Crossroads. Ghost Light toured as an opening act for Greensky Bluegrass in the winter of 2020.\n",
      "Ghost Light was formed at the end of 2017 with two established mainstays in the jam band music scene, Tom Hamilton & Holly Bowling. The original assembly of the band occurred in a studio in Philadelphia, PA. This allowed the band to bond and grow through the music writing process.  Unlike most Jam Bands, Ghost Light decided to start by recording an album before ever playing a live show. The band launched their first tour with a sold-out show in San Diego, CA and performed in over 25 venues across the United States throughout 2018.  \nOn March 22, 2019, Ghost Light released their debut album Best Kept Secrets.  At their show that night in Minneapolis, MN they performed the album in its entirety. Ghost Light played 59 shows in 2019 and has 20 scheduled performances for 2020.\n",
      "Andy J. Gordon described Ghost Light's improvisational live show at the Teragram Ballroom as having \"reached glorious synchronicity that has made their recent live shows a revelation.\"\n"
