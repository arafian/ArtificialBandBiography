      "Wavorly is an American rock band from Tupelo, Mississippi.\n",
      "Wavorly formed in 2001 under the name Freshmen 15, and independently released two albums under this name. The group changed its name after signing to Flicker Records because they \"didn't want to be thirty years old and be like, 'I'm in \"Freshmen 15\". I have three kids.'\" The name Wavorly comes from a haunted mansion in West Point, Mississippi. Their major label debut, Conquering the Fear of Flight, was released on Flicker on June 12, 2007, and has lyrics significantly influenced by the writings of C. S. Lewis.\n",
      "The band's single \"Part One\" received significant airplay on US Christian radio and was heavily rotated on the Gospel Music Channel's Rock Block. Also, it had been confirmed that Wavorly was in the process of finishing their next album, which was slated for a 2011 release. Rob Graves, producer of Conquering the Fear of Flight and other bands such as RED and Pillar, was confirmed as producer. Former RED guitarist Jasen Rauch had also been confirmed as a co-producer.\nWavorly released an EP entitled \"The EP\" On November 11, 2011.\n"
