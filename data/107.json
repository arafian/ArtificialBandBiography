This lineup included lead vocalist/bassist Todd Gullion, drummer Sander Leech, and guitarist Chris Lyon. In 2001, Ryan Downey joined the group as lead vocalist, and former lead vocalist/bassist Todd Gullion continued on bass and backing vocals. The band played one show with this line up at legendary 924 Gilman Street; soon after Ryan left the band on good terms. 2002 saw the release of A Second Engine, their first full-length album, and their first release on Equal Vision Records. The band attracted attention for its openly political lyrical stances.[2] Sander Leech having prior obligations could not go out to support the record so Eric Alexander joined playing drums. Todd Gullion asked friend Jesse Hayes to step in and play bass so he could focus on vocals. This lineup toured heavily for a year and a half. Eric Alexander parted ways with the band and moved to Los Angeles to focus on session drumming. The winter of 2003 Sander Leech returned for a brief tour supporting Year of the Rabbit and Thursday. Sander contributed to early songwriting for Alone with the Alone, but the record was eventually performed by new drummer Adam Goldstein. 2004 saw the release Time In Malta’s final studio album, issued on on Equal Vision Records.[3] The band disbanded winter of 2004.\n",
         "Soon after the breakup Jesse Hayes went on to play for San Francisco pop band LoveLikeFire, leaving the band in 2007.\n",
