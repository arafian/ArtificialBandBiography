      "Love/Hate is a Los Angeles, California based hard rock band.\n",
      "Love/Hate was formed in 1985, when Jizzy Pearl (real name Jim Wilkinson) joined Jon E. Love, Skid Rose, and Joey Gold, in a 1980s influenced electronica band called Dataclan, after their previous lead singer walked out while playing in Japan. They lived together in a Los Angeles warehouse called SoulHouse, and in the first year put out a four track EP and played a short and not very well received tour of Mexico. At this time the band had a very 'glam' look, wearing make up.\n",
      "In 1986 the band renamed themselves as Love/Hate from a song they played at the time called Love and Hate. They also changed their look and style to a more gothic image, having been influenced by the release of the album Love by The Cult. For the next couple of years they tried various styles of music and were pitched to many record companies in an attempt to get signed.\n"
