      "Spitboy was an American anarcho-punk band founded in the San Francisco bay area, in California in 1990.  The all-female band aggressively criticized patriarchy and gender roles but did not associate with the contemporaneous riot grrrl movement.  They released several records and toured extensively before disbanding in 1995. Members later played in the bands Instant Girl and Aus Rotten, while drummer Michelle Cruz Gonzales and vocalist Adrienne Droogas have been active as writers.\n",
      "Spitboy was founded by drummer Michelle \"Todd\" Gonzales, vocalist Adrienne Droogas, bassist Paula, and guitarist Karin Gembus. Paula left the band before the release of the Rasana 7\" EP and was replaced by Dominique Davison.\n",
      "The band toured the United States, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.  Their records were released on prominent punk rock labels Lookout Records, Allied Recordings, and Ebullition Records, including a split LP with the Chicago-based hardcore group Los Crudos.\n"
