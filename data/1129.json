      "Autolux is an American alternative rock band consisting of Eugene Goreshter (vocals, bass), Greg Edwards (vocals, guitar, piano) and Carla Azar (drums, vocals). The trio formed in 2001 and have released three full-length albums, Future Perfect (2004), Transit Transit (2010)  and Pussy's Dead (2016). Their eclectic sound draws from post-punk, electronic music and krautrock.\n",
      "Autolux was formed in 2001 in Los Angeles, California. Goreshter and Azar met while writing the score for Nobel Prize-winner Dario Fo's play Accidental Death of an Anarchist. Azar met Edwards when he was on tour with his band, Failure. In August 2001, Autolux made their live debut, playing two shows at The Fold in Silverlake Lounge. In March 2001, the band released a self-released EP, Demonstration. It contained five songs recorded on an 8-track in their rehearsal space.\n",
      "T-Bone Burnett signed Autolux to DMZ, a small label created by Burnett and the Coen Brothers, and \"nurtured\" the band.\n"
