      "The name X27 comes from the film Dishonored, where Marlene Dietrich plays Agent X27 who hides code in her music; it is not related to the X27 bus route in Brooklyn, where they are based. X27 are influenced by punk, experimental, contemporary classical, Music of North Africa, grunge, and 60's pop. Rikkeh recently said, \"I want to make music for people who think AC/DC and Led Zeppelin are great American rock bands.\"\n",
