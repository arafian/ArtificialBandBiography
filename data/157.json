   "History": {
      "text": [
         "Looking to start a punk band, Livermore had trouble finding members, citing the majority of the local musicians being hippies and \"completely uninterested in the music we wanted to make.\" [1] Eventually, Livermore recruited  14-year-old Kain Hanschke on bass and 12-year-old  Frank Edwin \"Tré\" Wright III on drums.  Although he had never before played drums, young Tré showed an instant affinity for them, likely because, as Livermore said, \"he loved making a lot of noise and getting everyone to look at him.\"\n",
         "Claiming that the members needed \"punk rock names,\" Livermore gave his fellow musicians new last names.  Kain's surname went from Hanschke to \"Kong,\" while Tré went from Wright to \"Cool.\"  It has often been claimed that Livermore was the person to dub Cool with \"Tré.\"  His family had long before given him the nickname, a play on the word \"tres,\" or \"three,\" as he was the third Frank Edwin in his family.\n",
         "The Lookouts recorded three albums,Lookout!  It's the Lookouts, One Planet One People, and Spy Rock Road, and two EPs, Mendocino Homeland and IV.\n",
         "From there, Livermore went on to running his record label, named Lookout Records; One Planet One People was the first release in the label's history.  Livermore eventually sold Lookout Records to business partner Chris Appelgren in the mid-1990s.  Kong became a National Park Service park ranger.  Cool became drummer for Green Day, after they were left in a lurch by their first drummer.\n",
         "In 2015, Don Giovanni Records released Spy Rock Road and Other Stories, a compilation featuring all of the tracks from Spy Rock Road, Mendocino Homeland and IV, a few compilation tracks and one from their demo Lookout! It's the Lookouts. Besides a couple of compilation appearances, this marked the first time the band's recordings were released on CD\n"
