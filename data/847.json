      "The Budos Band is an American instrumental band from Staten Island, New York, formed in 2005. AllMusic describes the group as a \"doom rock Afro-soul big band with a '70s touch\" that joins \"musical universes from trippy psychedelia and Afro-funk to '70s hard rock and late-'60s soul.\" They have described themselves as \"70's Psychedelic Instrumental Music,\" and \"Afro-soul inspired by Ethiopian music with a soul undercurrent\" and \"sprinkled a little bit of sweet 60's stuff on top.\" One reviewer described the band as “sounding as if Quentin Tarantino was the music supervisor for a Bond film\". Their more recent albums have incorporated sounds from 1970s jazz, funk, Afro-Beat, underground rock, and proto-metal. They have been signed to Daptone Records throughout their career.\n",
      "The Budos Band originated at a jam session hosted by the New York band Antibalas. Some of the participants decided to form the new band, which has consisted of an occasionally floating lineup featuring David Guy and Andrew Greene (trumpets), Cochemea Gastelum (tenor sax), Jared Tankel (baritone sax), Dame Rodriguez and Vincent Balestrino (percussion), Thomas Brenneck (guitar), Robert Lombardo (congas), Mike Deller (organ), Daniel Foder (bass), and Brian Profilio and John Carbonella Jr. (drums). Their self-titled debut album was released in 2005 and featured guest appearances by Bosco Mann and Neal Sugarman.\n",
      "The Budos Band II and The Budos Band III were released in 2007 and 2010, respectively. During this period the band members, in various permutations, backed several other acts associated with the Daptone label, including an acclaimed appearance on \"Changes\" by Charles Bradley. The fourth Budos Band album, Burnt Offering, was released in 2014 and was noted for incorporating elements from hard rock and heavy metal. The band was saddened by the deaths of labelmates Sharon Jones in 2016 and Charles Bradley in 2017, with some members moving to other states and starting families.\n"
