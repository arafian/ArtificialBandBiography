      "Tea Leaf Green is an American four-piece jam band from the San Francisco Bay Area, composed of Josh Clark (guitar and vocals), Trevor Garrod (keyboards, vocals, guitar, and harmonica), Scott Rager (drums), and Eric DiBerardino (bass).\n",
      "Tea Leaf Green began in the fall of 1996, when Scott Rager met Ben Chambers on the campus of San Francisco State University. Chambers was the group's original bass player but left in 2007; he is featured on the band's first four albums. Rager and Chambers began playing together, practicing in Chambers's bedroom in a back house off Church Street in the Castro District. In early 1997, Clark, a childhood friend of Rager, moved from Los Angeles to San Francisco and became the third member of the band. Garrod, also a SFSU student, joined soon after.\n",
      "In the late-1990s, Tea Leaf Green began performing throughout San Francisco, becoming the de facto house band at the Elbo Room for a period in 1999. The band's first album, eponymously titled, was produced by Jimmy Foot and engineered by Jimmy and Susie Foot. It was released on Bongo Boy Records and featured twelve original compositions, including songs such as \"Professor's Blues\", \"Asphalt Funk\", and \"California\", all of which remained part of the band's live repertoire for years.\n"
