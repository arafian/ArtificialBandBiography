         "Claudia Sinesi and Maria Gabriela Epumer met in 1978, and played together in a garage band. Epumer joined the cover band Rouge in 1982, and proposed that Sinesi joined it as well.

Sinesi and Epumer stayed together, and Mavi Diaz proposed them to start an all-girls band. Their first long play was released in 1984, with songs such as \"Potpourri (Olla podrida)\", \"Te Encargo mi Modernidad\" and \"Bikini a Lunares, Amarillo, Diminuto, Justo Justo\", a cover of Brian Hyland's single Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini. The second long play included a popular cover of the song \"Lollipop\".[1][2]\n",
