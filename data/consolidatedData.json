      "The Codetalkers were a jazz, rock and roll band from Savannah, Georgia, composed of Bobby Lee Rodgers, (lead vocals, electric banjo, guitar, \"air trombone\"), Mark Raudabaugh (drums, vocals) and Andrew Altman (bass, vocals). The band was formed in 1999, upon the meeting of Rodgers and Col. Bruce Hampton at a show at the Variety Playhouse in Atlanta.  The group toured for many years as a four-piece with the lineup of Rodgers, Hampton, Greenwell and Pecchio.  In the spring of 2006, the band announced they would be touring without Hampton, who was stepping down for a multitude of reasons. The band was aiming to undertake a heavy touring schedule in support of their recent release, in which Hampton was unwilling and unable to participate. He had lent his name to the project for years in order to help Rodgers gain the recognition Hampton felt he deserved, but as a touring musician for 40 years, the grueling demands that a national tour would place on him didn't seem very alluring.  Coincidentally, just as this announcement was to be made, Hampton trumped the press release by citing his own health reasons for leaving the band.\n",

      "Led by Tad Doyle (born Thomas Andrew Doyle) on vocals and guitar, Tad was formed in early 1988 by Doyle, a drummer turned guitar player/singer, who asked bassist Kurt Danielson to play bass for the band. Danielson's band Bundle of Hiss played with Doyle's previous band (in which he played drums) H-Hour. Tad recruited drummer Steve Wied (formerly of Skin Yard) and guitarist Gary Thorstensen to complete the original lineup. Tad was among the first bands to be signed to the independent label Sub Pop Records. In 1988, Doyle had released the \"Daisy/Ritual Device\" single on Sub Pop, produced by seminal Seattle producer Jack Endino, for which Doyle wrote and performed all music. Tad's debut album God's Balls appeared in early 1989 and was also produced by Endino. In March 1990 the band released the Salt Lick EP, recorded by Steve Albini. It contained the song \"Wood Goblins\", for which a music video was produced. After a European tour with Nirvana, Tad returned to Seattle and recorded their second album 8-Way Santa (1991), named after a type of blotter acid. Produced by Butch Vig, the album was far more pop-oriented than its predecessors, and featured the singles \"Jinx\" and \"Jack Pepsi\". \n",

      "Brown, Flower, and Schmaljohn were ex-members of the Boise punk band State of Confusion. The three would link up with Martsch and form Treepeople in 1988. The band gained local notoriety and success in the late 1980s and early 1990s in regional scenes. This lineup recorded the No Mouth Pipetting self-released album in 1989, and then shortly released the Time Whore EP the following year. The band's next album would be Guilt Regret Embarrassment in 1991, released through two small labels, Toxic Shock Records and K Records. Afterwards in 1992, Flower had left the band, and Tony Reed was recruited as the new drummer. This lineup would record the Something Vicious for Tomorrow EP; however, the band had more label backing on this release, as they had signed with the label C/Z Records, and would stay with them for the remainder of their career. The label wanted to make the release a full-length; thus, they included the previously-released Time Whore EP as an add-on. \n",
      "Following the demise of his previous band The Storybook Krooks, Robert Roth auditioned to play guitar for Nirvana but they ultimately decided to continue as a trio.  A month later, Roth says he met up with Pickerel as he (Roth) was beginning to write new songs for what would become his signature venture:\n",

      "Jeff Gilbert and Tad Doyle were instrumental in Willard's record deal, which resulted in the Endino-produced Steel Mill in 1992. Gilbert called Willard the \"drunkest band in Seattle\" in his Rocket article. They had previously released a self-titled four song EP on Jerry O'Neill's aka Gerald Weymeth's Green Gel Records.  After performing an outdoor show for the \"Pain in the Grass\" Festival at the Seattle Center, Willard was banned from further performances by the Seattle Police Department and the City of Seattle, resulting in  band shirts displaying \"Banned by the SPD\". The music of Willard was sonically similar to another Seattle band, Melvins. Otis was an early member of Napalm Beach, Clint and Peters played in H-Hour, while Wied was the original drummer for Sub Pop artist  Tad.\n",
      "Wool formed in the early 1990s when brothers Peter and Franz Stahl (vocals/guitar and guitar/vocals, respectively) were forced to terminate their popular band Scream after bassist Skeeter Thompson left the band and after drummer Dave Grohl joined Seattle grunge band Nirvana midway through a U.S. tour.\nThe brothers then teamed up with former Government Issue and future Burning Airlines drummer Peter Moffett and Seattle native and ex-Concrete Blonde bassist Al Bloch (brother of Seattle Sub-Pop legend Kurt Bloch from the Fastbacks).\n",
      "The members of Ace of Cups were Mary Gannon (bass), Marla Hunt (organ, piano), Denise Kaufman (guitar, harmonica), Mary Ellen Simpson (lead guitar), and Diane Vitalich (drums). Lead vocals were sung by all members of the band except Vitalich, and all five sang backup. The songwriting, too, was divided among the band members.\n",
      "While the original line-up consisted of McKenzie, Whitehurst and drummer Brett Friesen; Brett was replaced shortly after the release of their first EP at the end of 2006. Taking over drumming duties would be Jake Krohn, formerly of The Rum Diary; also added to The Action Design crew would be Jaycen McKissick, formerly of Pipedown, on guitar. With the addition of Krohn and McKissick, The Action Design would complete their line-up. In order to begin touring and playing shows as soon as possible, they enlisted Bobby from the band Kiev to fill in on keyboards for their first tour as a band on the 2007 Warped Tour. The band later began playing their set as a foursome without Bobby who returned to his work with his band. Each band member began pulling double duty; picking up the keyboard parts on their respective instruments.\nThe Action Design released a limited edition EP with only 1000 pressings in the fall of 2006 and quickly sold out without having played a single show. This version of the EP was recorded when the band was still a three piece and did not feature much guitar work (if any on most of the recordings). It also contained the song \"Move On\" which was later omitted from the Popsmear released version of the E.P. \"Into a Sound\". This original pressing was completely self-published, with all of the artwork hand-printed and numbered by the band.\n",
      "Their first record, Terrible Things Happen was released in 1998, receiving glowing reviews in CMJ, The Big Takeover, and numerous indie pop zines, earning enough of a following to generate a tour of Japan in April 1999. Terrible Things Happen (as with the rest of the Aislers Set's music) was recorded in Linton's tiny basement studio on an analog 8 track machine.\n",
      "Animosity formed in  2000 in San Francisco, California. They released their debut album, Shut It Down, on Tribunal Records in 2003, when the members of the band were 16 and 17 years old. In 2005, they released their second disc, Empires, on Black Market Activities (with distribution through Metal Blade Records) and toured the United States with Origin and Malevolent Creation. Their third album, Animal, was produced by Kurt Ballou of Converge and released in October 2007. They have also toured Europe with Converge and Belgian hardcore/punk band Rise and Fall. Animosity disbanded officially after nearly a year of non-activity in October 2009. The band's frontman Leo Miller stated that their \"musical and experiential goals have been exceeded\" and: \"If you haven't gotten enough of Animosity, please rest assured that we have.\"\n",
      "They achieved notoriety early on with songs such as \"Sit On My Face\" and \"Killer Purses\" performed at benefits for the SFGMC, Theatre Rhinoceros, and the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.  They derived their name from psychiatric testimony at Dan White's trial for killing Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk.\n",
      "The song's main riff was written by Joe Perry on a Fender Bass VI, which gives the song its distinctive \"growl\".  Brad Whitford plays the lead guitar part.  \"Back in the Saddle\" also features one of the heaviest and most noticeable bass lines by Tom Hamilton.  The song is also notable for the slow buildup of the drum beat and guitar riff in the beginning of the song, as well as the sound effects of a galloping horse and whips, and screams and yodeling by Steven Tyler at the end of the song.  A real bullwhip was intended to be used for the whip effects and hours were spent trying to get it to crack.  The band members ended up cut up and hurt without making any progress.  Eventually, the band decided the whip effects would be created by whirling a 30-foot cord from the studio, then by firing a cap gun to create the crack of the whip (the sound effects are more prominent in the Quadraphonic mix of the album (Columbia CAQ 34165)).  When the song is performed in concert, Tyler often makes more noticeable lyrical and visible references to sex.  Although the lyrics, by Tyler, were written with the simple idea of cowboys and sex, this song took on new meaning after Aerosmith reunited in 1984 and embarked on their Back in the Saddle Tour.\n",

      "The band was formed by Miles Kurosky and Bill Swan in San Francisco in 1996, while the pair were both working in the same office. The pair discovered that they shared similar musical tastes and, disregarding some mutual dislike, decided to form a band. This early incarnation of Beulah recorded a song every 6 weeks for 16 months, on their 4-track recorder. The band received attention from The Apples in Stereo frontman and Elephant 6 member Robert Schneider, who expressed interest on releasing what was to be their first single, A Small Cattle Drive in a Snow Storm, on Elephant 6 records. Their first album, Handsome Western States, was released in the same year, also on Elephant 6 and mastered by Schneider. The record soon sold out. This association with the collective has continued throughout their career, despite the fact that they did not release anything more on the label - they are listed as being part of the close family of Elephant 6 bands, on the official Elephant 6 website, and they have toured with other collective members, such as Dressy Bessy, Ladybug Transistor, The Olivia Tremor Control and of Montreal. In order to tour in support of the album, Steve La Follette, Steve St. Cin, and Pat Noel joined the band, with the band playing their first shows in support of the Apples.\n",
      "Leader Peter Albin, a country-blues guitarist who had played with future Grateful Dead founders Jerry Garcia and Ron McKernan, met Sam Andrew, a professional rock guitarist with a jazz and classical background. After playing together at Albin's home, Andrew suggested they form a band. The pair approached guitarist James Gurley, the resulting threesome playing open jam sessions hosted by entrepreneur Chet Helms in 1965. Helms found them a drummer, Chuck Jones, and Big Brother and the Holding Company was formed at their first gig, the Trips Festival in January 1966. In the audience was painter and jazz drummer David Getz, who soon displaced Jones.\n",
      "Bracket emerged during the pop punk resurgence of the early 1990s and released its first two albums 924 Forestville St. (1994) and 4-Wheel Vibe (1995) on Caroline Records.  Following a staff shake-up, the label dropped the group and cancelled the release of its third album Like You Know in 1996.  Bracket's next two albums Novelty Forever (1997) and When All Else Fails (2000) were put out by Fat Wreck Chords, who had previously issued 7-inch vinyl for the band.  Having completed multiple tours of the United States and trips to Canada, Europe and Japan throughout their career, Bracket released Live in a Dive (2002) which gathered some of the band's best-known material into one performance.  After building their own studio, the group took several years to write, record and self-produce its sixth album Requiem (2006), released by Takeover Records.  Bracket began work on a new album in 2011, detailing each stage of the recording process on its official Facebook page. Like You Know and the three volume rarities collection Rare Cuts were issued as digital downloads in 2013 to help fund the band's upcoming projects.  Bracket's seventh studio album, Hold Your Applause was released in August 2014.August 2016 saw the release of Bracket's eighth full-length album, The Last Page. The 70 minute album consisted of one “song”, the 28th installment of their “Warren’s Song” series. The band recorded nearly 100 short fragments of songs, with the intention of piecing them together to create the 70 minute “Warren’s Song Pt. 28”. Bracket completed work on their ninth studio album in late 2018, with a release planned for early 2019.\n",
      "Butch Engle & the Styx was an American rock band formed in 1963 in Mill Valley, California. Originally named The Showmen, the members were Butch Engle (vocals), Bob Zamora (lead guitar), Mike Pardee (organ), Harry \"Happiness\" Smith (bass), and Rich Morrison (drums). The band released three singles before breaking up in 1968. A compilation album featuring all of the band's recordings, No Matter What You Say: The Best of Butch Engle & the Styx, was released in 2000.\n",
      "The original line-up of the band was former Love Circus and Leaches singer Mark Zanandrea (vocals, guitar), former Ophelias guitarist Sam Babbitt, former X-tal bassist Alan Korn, and Donner Party drummer Melanie Clarin. They signed to Enigma/Restless, and released their debut album, Hubba (produced by Matt Piucci of Rain Parade), in 1987, described as a mix of \"punk, post-punk, folk-rock, and country\". They followed this in 1988 with Submarine, this time with David Lowery producing. Zanandrea and Clarin then left, to be replaced by Barry Hall and John Stewart, continuing as The (ex) Cat Heads, although Clarin returned to guest (on \"Anti-song\") on their 1989 album Our Frisco. Clarin and Zanandrea, meanwhile had joined It Thing. Zanandrea and Babbitt later worked together in The Androgynauts. Babbitt and Korn re-emerged in The Mudsills.\n",
      "Exhibiting more pronounced jug band, country and blues influences than many bands from the same scene, the Charlatans' rebellious attitude and distinctive late 19th-century fashions exerted a strong influence on the Summer of Love in San Francisco. The band's recorded output was small. Following difficulties with various record labels, their only album, The Charlatans, was recorded and released by a reconstituted lineup (with only two members of the original group) in 1969.\n",
      "They found little commercial success as part of San Francisco's 1970s music scene, but developed a cult following in the United Kingdom and Germany following the release of the LPs Alien Soundtracks (1977) and Half Machine Lip Moves (1979). Edge died in 1995; subsequently, guitarist Helios Creed has revived the Chrome name for recordings and performances.\n",
      "Formed by members of the band Tiny Hearing Aid Company, Clover's sound moved on from Bay Area psychedelia to the burgeoning country rock sound, similar to Creedence Clearwater Revival. The original line-up was based out of San Francisco, and was a quartet consisting of Alex Call (lead vocals, guitar), John McFee (guitar, pedal steel), John Ciambiotti (bass) and Mitch Howie (drums). 1970 saw their debut self-titled album released on Fantasy Records.  A 1971 follow-up entitled Fourty Niner   also appeared on the same label.\n",
      "Their music often focused on vegetarianism, women's rights, animal rights, fighting racism and homophobia, the unity of oppression, World War II and the Holocaust, the dangers of capitalism, and the evils of American nationalism. Although often criticized as having strident and confrontational lyrics, Consolidated tempered the intensity of their songs with many instances of self-deprecating humor.  They admitted to their own struggles with addressing complex social issues within the constraining structures of pop music, an artistic form they referred to as \"a neutralized medium,\" but explained that they did so because they felt that it might be their only chance to reach a mass audience with progressive messages of social justice.\n",
      "The band's sound was characterized by simple rock-and-roll arrangements played at intensely high volumes. Michael Goldberg, critic for New York Rocker magazine, wrote in 1978: \"Crime play loud. So loud that the plate glass window at the opposite end of the club shakes, tables tremble and people hang onto their drinks. Loudness may be Crime's only musical raison d'etre. This band is a literal translation of the concept 'minimal.' Drummer Hank Rank thumps out a simple Bo Diddley beat that is only adequate in the context of the rest of the band. Bassist Ron the Ripper coaxes a thick rumble from his amp that reminds one of the thunder of a bulldozer rolling over rugged terrain. And the guitar playing of  Strike and Frankie Fix make you feel like you've been forcefully held underwater for the full 25 minutes of the set.\"\n",
      "Deafheaven's musical style has been described by Rolling Stone as a \"boundary-pushing blend of black metal, shoegaze and post-rock\". McCoy has cited various other influences on the band's sound, including alternative rock and early thrash metal, and said they do not consider themselves a black metal band, because, although influenced by the genre, they do not have \"the ethos, the aesthetic or really the sound of one\". In a 2017 interview with Red Bull Music Academy Daily, McCoy stated: \"The whole shoegaze/black metal, or post-black metal thing, was being done ten years before we were a band.\"\n",
      "Death Angel is often referred to as one of the key bands in the Bay Area thrash metal movement of the 1980s, and secured opening slots at club venues that decade, including opening for their peers Megadeth, Metallica, Slayer, Exodus, Testament, Overkill, D.R.I., Mercyful Fate and Possessed. They are also often credited as one of the leaders of the second wave of thrash metal movement from the 1980s, and considered to be one of the \"big eight\" of the genre (along with Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Testament, Exodus and Overkill). Following the underground success of their first two studio albums, The Ultra-Violence (1987) and Frolic Through the Park (1988), Death Angel signed to Geffen Records in 1989, and released their only album for the label, Act III, the following year. While they were touring in support of Act III, then-drummer Andy Galeon was injured in a tour bus accident and needed more than a year to fully recover. This resulted in the band's break up in 1991. However, Death Angel reformed in 2001 (without original rhythm guitarist Gus Pepa) at the Thrash of the Titans benefit concert for Testament singer Chuck Billy. The band has since released six more albums, including Humanicide (2019), to which the title track gave Death Angel their first-ever Grammy Award nomination.\n",

      "The Dodos began playing music together in 2005, when musician Meric Long, who had been gigging steadily in San Francisco as a solo singer-songwriter, was introduced to Logan Kroeber through a mutual friend (a college acquaintance of Long's that happened to be Kroeber's cousin). The Dodos are a band of two, clean-cut halves. One of the duo was a student of West African Ewe drumming and intricate Blues fingerpicking guitar, the other hails from a background in heavy metal bands. Going from the raw, acoustic roots-rock on their albums ‘Visiter’ and ‘No Color’ to the more expansive, pop sound of ‘Time to Die’ and ‘Carrier’; guitarist-vocalist Meric Long and drummer Logan Kroeber have spent their career seeking to blur the line between the inherently melodic nature of Long's guitar and the rhythmic, atonal clatter of Kroeber's drums. Their most recent album ‘Individ’ can be seen as a resolution of this duality, combining their old acoustic sensibilities with an expansive vision and sound, and this performance served as further proof.\n",
      "The band's history can be roughly divided into three eras. From 1970 to 1975 it featured lead vocalist Johnston and a mainstream rock and roll sound with elements of folk, country and R&B. Johnston left the group in 1977 due to health reasons, and was replaced by Michael McDonald, whose interest in soul music changed the band's sound until it broke up in 1982 with Simmons being the only constant member having appeared on all of their albums. In 1987, the Doobie Brothers reformed with Johnston back in the fold; McDonald, who had previously made several guest appearances since their reformation, returned to the band full-time in 2019 for their upcoming 50th anniversary tour. Every incarnation of the group has emphasized vocal harmonies. The Doobie Brothers were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on November 7, 2020. The group has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide. Founding members John Hartman and Dave Shogren, Tiran Porter, Michael Hossack, Keith Knudsen and Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter are former members of the band.\n",
      "All the founding band members were born in 1979; Brett Anderson (vocals) on May 30; Allison Robertson (guitar and vocals) on August 26; and Maya Ford (bass guitar and vocals) and Torry Castellano (drums, percussion, vocals), both on January 8. They all became friends by eighth grade and formed as a band in May 1993 to play for their school's \"Day on the Green.\" One of two all-female bands in their town Palo Alto, California, they were relatively unknown until they were out of high school. They are all self-taught musicians and practiced in Castellano's garage nearly every day during their years at Palo Alto High School. They called themselves \"Ragady Anne\" in their early days and shortly thereafter changed their name to \"The Electrocutes\".\n",
      "The band's sound is considered experimental pop/rock with influences from 1970s progressive rock. In the summer of 2005, they had a national tour in support of their first album Time to Echolocate, which culminated in a performance at the CMJ music marathon in New York City and the Northwest Music Fest in Portland, OR.\n",
      "Eddie & the Tide (originally named \"The Suburbs\" until forced to change their name by court order) played frequently during the early 1980s in the Santa Cruz and San Francisco Bay Area at venues such as the Monterey Music Hall in Monterey, The Keystone in Palo Alto, The Stone in San Francisco, and The Catalyst in Santa Cruz and built a loyal following. Eventually signed by Bobby Corona who owned the Keystone night clubs, they released the independent EP \"Maybe I'll Get Lucky\" in 1982 which went on to be the biggest selling indie release to date in California.\n",
      "Prior to their formation, David Jones, the main songwriter in Enemy You, recorded several releases with his pop punk band After School Special on Mutant Pop Records. The group never toured or played a show, but still had a small dedicated following. In 1997, Enemy You was formed and began rehearsing together. They were heavily inspired by Bad Religion and other melodic punk acts. After Enemy You began writing tunes together as a band they received interest from Ben Weasel and his fledgling label, Panic Button Records. Weasel would often call Fat Wreck Chords, and heard about the band through Chris, who was the bassist for Enemy You, and an employee at Fat Wreck Chords. This led to their debut appearance on the four-way split dubbed Four On The Floor alongside Screeching Weasel, Teen Idols and Moral Crux. This was followed by their debut album, Where No One Knows My Name, in 1999. Based on the album's success the band was asked to open for a number of notable punk bands including Bouncing Souls, Lagwagon, Bad Religion, T.S.O.L., Mad Caddies, and NOFX. The band released a 7-inch on the Fat Club series on Fat Wreck Chords. They followed that with an 1980s-themed seven inch EP that came out on Geykido Comet Records, titled \"Video to Radio.\" Geykido Comet Records re-released the EP in 2017, with all the proceeds going to suicide prevention. Around this time, guitarist, Ken Yamazaki, started to play guitar for the Hardcore punk band, Western Addiction. He still stayed with Enemy You, though. In 2005 the band released their second album, Stories Never Told on Red Scare Industries. David was friends with label owner, Toby Jeg, and the label also eventually re-released \n",

The band has since reunited, conducting The Second Coming Tour between 2009 and 2010, and releasing its seventh studio album, Sol Invictus, in May 2015. Following the touring cycle of Sol Invictus, Faith No More went on hiatus once again. In November 2019, the band made the announcement that they would be reuniting to embark on a 2020 UK and European tour.

First Blood also went on tour that year with Ignite, Comeback Kid, The Red Chord, Sick of It All, Stretch Arm Strong, and others, and appeared at the New England Metal Fest on April 29. The band then toured extensively in 2007 with the likes of Full Blown Chaos, Since the Flood and Death Before Dishonor.\n",
      "The band signed to United Artists Records in 1972, releasing just three more singles until 1976. The Groovies then signed to Sire Records and released three albums between 1976 and 1979, Shake Some Action, Flamin' Groovies Now (both produced by Dave Edmunds at Rockfield Studios in Wales) and Jumpin' in the Night. The 1976 album's title track \"Shake Some Action\" (also released as a single) became a power pop anthem and is revered by many, including Greil Marcus in his book, The History of Rock and Roll in Ten Songs. Wilson left the band in 1981, and the band continued in various forms, including the release of three more albums, before breaking up in 1991. After a couple of limited reunions with different lineups, the 1970s nucleus of Jordan, Wilson, and Alexander reformed the group in 2013, and the band's first post-reunion album, Fantastic Plastic, was released in 2017. Alexander left the reformed band in 2017, and in 2019 Wilson went on hiatus.\n",
      "Flipper was founded by former Sleepers member Ricky Williams (vocals), former Rad Command member Ted Falconi (guitar), and former Negative Trend members Will Shatter (bass) and Steve DePace (drums). Founding member and original vocalist Williams was credited for naming the band, but was fired before it made any recordings. Bruce “Loose” Calderwood replaced Williams and he and Shatter then went on to trade vocal and bass duties, with both bringing a bass onstage. Falconi, a Vietnam War veteran, played a uniquely distorted style of guitar.\n",
      "The band's music generally consisted of hard, garage and blues rock. Their next album, Bone to Pick (1995) also incorporated heavy metal. The band collaborated with Peter McConnell of LucasArts to produce the soundtrack to the biker-themed adventure game Full Throttle; tracks from Bone to Pick were specifically adapted for this purpose. Blue Pyramid (1998), their third and final album, also included experimentation with psychedelic rock.\n",
      "The band's origins date from when Santana guitarist Neal Schon formed the band Azteca in 1972 along with Larry Graham (bass guitar) and Gregg Errico (drums), both from Sly & the Family Stone, and Pete Sears (keyboards), from Hot Tuna and Jefferson Starship. Santana bass guitar player Tom Rutley would move into the bass spot with Azteca. That band, like Santana with heavy Latin influences, would eventually morph into Graham Central Station, while Schon would form Journey. The invention of electric slap bass is attributed by many (including Victor Wooten and Bootsy Collins) to Graham, which influenced many musical genres, such as funk, R&B and disco.\n",
      "In the late summer of 1965, Grace, Darby, and Jerry were inspired by The Beatles to start their own group.

      "In 1970 John Rewind was teaching guitar at Roger Calkins Music on Market Street in San Francisco, California. One of his students, Lee Humphries, kept telling John about the talents of his buddy Joe Crane, with whom he was in the Coast Guard. Joe played bass with Johnny & Edgar Winter in high school back in Conroe, Texas, and had been produced by the infamous Huey Meaux. Between Lee's description, and confirmation from Al Amis, who also worked at Roger Calkins and had heard Joe sing, John went to the Alameda, California, Coast Guard Officer's Club to see Joe perform, and the Hoodoo Rhythm Devils were born. Another one of John's guitar students, \"Funky Jack\" Leahy, who lived up the street from John in the Haight-Ashbury district, had just closed his poster business Funky Features, and was getting into recording and was building a studio. When Jack heard Joe and John, he took the lead and started recording the band and making connections for the band to get a recording contract with a major label. After a few personnel changes, Glenn Walter, who had played drums in a band called The Zoo and released a single in St. Louis, Missouri, with John during the 1960s, joined the band, along with Richard Greene (aka Dexter C. Plates) on bass. Richard had played in groups around the Washington, D.C. area, most notably with Roberta Flack.\n",
      "The members of Hot Flash Heat Wave all grew up in Davis, California, and first met in high school. The members came up with the name Hot Flash Heat Wave due to a period of hot weather in San Francisco. In 2015, Hot Flash Heat Wave released their first full-length album, Neapolitan. In June 2016, the band released their first song since their debut full-length album, titled \"Bye Bye Bye\".

The band's name came from someone Jorma Kaukonen referred to as a \"witty wag\" who called out, \"hot tuna\" after hearing the line 'What's that smell like fish, oh baby,' from the song \"Keep On Truckin'.\" Kaukonen, Jack Casady, Paul Kantner and new drummer Joey Covington played several shows around San Francisco, including the Airplane's original club, The Matrix, before Jefferson Airplane resumed performing to support Volunteers. (Although Covington had been hired by Jefferson Airplane, he only performed at select engagements, with Spencer Dryden continuing to perform as the band's principal drummer until his 1970 dismissal). Once the Airplane had resumed touring, Tuna found itself opening for the Airplane. Their early repertoire derived mainly from Kaukonen's Airplane material and covers of American country and blues artists such as Reverend Gary Davis, Jelly Roll Morton, Bo Carter and Blind Blake.\n",

According to Ott, the name came from a nickname for a girl they knew who had \"bleached-blond, burned, crimped hair.\" The group initially wanted a female singer, but couldn't find one so Ott took over on vocals in late 1984 and they then went through various different line-ups during 1985. Ott began experimenting with playing synthesizer and piano, a man named Isaac joined on violin and Tim Armstrong (then known as Lint) played bass for a brief period. Pete Rypins joined as the group's bassist in October 1986 and, according to Cometbus, they \"started to get out of Jeff's basement and play some parties and shows.\"\n",

They are also often credited as one of the leaders of the second wave of thrash metal movement from the 1980s, and considered to be one of the \"big eight\" of the genre (along with Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Testament, Exodus and Overkill). Following the underground success of their first two studio albums, The Ultra-Violence (1987) and Frolic Through the Park (1988), Death Angel signed to Geffen Records in 1989, and released their only album for the label, Act III, the following year. While they were touring in support of Act III, then-drummer Andy Galeon was injured in a tour bus accident and needed more than a year to fully recover. This resulted in the band's break up in 1991. However, Death Angel reformed in 2001 (without original rhythm guitarist Gus Pepa) at the Thrash of the Titans benefit concert for Testament singer Chuck Billy.

In 1988, Gras fell out with the rest of the band and left before an important show at Gilman and a live appearance on the KFJC radio show. In a tight spot, the band asked the former guitarist Dodge, who before the formation of No Use had sung in other local bands, to rejoin as vocalist, which he agreed. This line-up of the band recorded two EPs; No Use For a Name on Woodpecker Records and Let 'em Out on on Slap A Ham Records. In 1989, Dodge left again which allowed Sly to take over vocals and songwriting.\n",

Lerios had formed a band while at Palo Alto High School. His classmate, Steve Price, signed on as a roadie (because he owned a van), then joined the group on drums when their drummer left.

      "The band was formed in 1964 by guitarist Roger Hedge, bass player Jim McPherson, guitarist Bob Rominger, and drummer Dennis Carrasco. The band was initially named \"The Trolls.\" All four members were vocalists, and, for its time, the group had an impressive vocal capability.  This enabled them not only to sing accurate covers, but to create unique and melodic vocal arrangements on original material, setting them apart from most of their competition.  Hedge put the group together, invested personal funds for equipment and promotion, and was the leader and business manager for the first couple of years. They performed in and around the San Jose area, releasing on their own, a McPherson tune, \"Walkin' Shoes\" which sold out in a matter of weeks in San Jose.\n",
      "Strata filmed a music video for the single \"The Panic\" in Romania, with the film crew who had recently filmed the movie Cold Mountain. In 2005, the band was set to begin a tour with Nonpoint when singer Eric Victorino developed polyps and nodes on his vocal cords, rendering him virtually mute and forcing Strata to drop off the tour. Victorino stayed in New York City for two weeks to undergo treatment, at which time he wrote most of the lyrics to songs that would become the band's next release. The remaining band and crew drove home to California, stopping in numerous cities to go bowling with fans who had tickets to see the canceled tour dates. In the summer of 2006, Strata headed to Southern England to begin recording Strata Presents The End Of The World, with producer Sam Williams, at the Sawmills Studio in Cornwall. Released on July 27, 2007, 'SPTEOTW' was a polarizing record. Fans of the previous album noted the band's new direction, Victorino's use of falsetto and the lyrical content loosely followed a plot throughout the album, leading to speculation that the release was a concept album. Strata filmed a music video for the single \"Stay Young\" in Northern Sweden. Strata toured in support of SPTEOTW until January 2008, when Victorino abruptly quit the band, giving no explanation as to why.\n",
      "The line-up formed in 1964, when Don Baskin (October 9, 1946–October 22, 2019; vocalist, guitar) and Bob Gonzalez (bass guitar), both originally from the outfit Lenny Lee and the Nightmen, united with a local group called the Pharaohs. The resulting band, the Syndicate of Sound, which, along with Baskin and Gonzalez, included John Sharkey (keyboards), Larry Ray (lead guitar), and John Duckworth (drums). Several other stand-ins performed with the band, most notably Dr. Kelly E. Hejtmancik Sr. (bass guitar) of Galveston TX during the band's Galveston filming of \"Little Girl\".\nIn the beginning stages of the band's existence, the group was influenced by R&B music, specifically the early musical styles of The Rolling Stones and The Beatles. After the group won a Bay Area \"Battle of the Bands\" against 100 other competing bands, the Syndicate of Sound earned a recording contract with Del-Fi Records. The band released a single, \"Prepare For Love\", which received local airplay, but ultimately failed to make an impact. Though the record was unsuccessful, it established the band's sound, combining striking vocal harmonies and innovative psychedelic instrumentals.\n",

There, local skaters gathered to skate \"Cab's\" backyard vert ramp and hang out. An early line up before the name \"The Faction\" was chosen included Steve Caballero, Gavin O'Brien, Craig Bosch, and Russ Wright. This lineup only lasted through a couple of practices when Craig Bosch left to join local punk band The Unaware. Bosch was replaced by Adam Segal who Steve and Gavin knew from Winchester Skate Park. Another local skater Craig Ramsey offered to manage the band under his production company Faction Productions. Discussions about a band name lead quickly to the adoption of Craig's production company name for the band itself. After recording a single demo of \"Spineless Majority\" with this line up, Adam switched to guitar and was replaced by drummer Keith Rendon. Russ Wright eventually left the band when his stepfather \"The Captain\" insisted Russ attend military school in Chico, California, leaving The Faction to carry on as a foursome.

Though each member was aware of one another, it was only Todd, Tim, and Andy who had played together. Tim, had joined Todd's band From Good Homes on stage, in addition Tim and Andy having a 20-year friendship through their former bands, The Blue Sparks From Hell, and New Jersey rock outfit Kings in Disguise.

Recorded live with no overdubs except backing vocals, this untitled demo set Railroad Earth's career in motion.  Within a week, they landed a slot at Telluride Bluegrass Festival, an appearance that was only the new band's tenth as Railroad Earth. The previous nine gigs had been little more than warm-ups at small North Jersey bars and Elks lodges and a couple of support slots for regional bands. Realizing immediately how strong the initial five-song demo was, the band decided to return to the same studio to cut another five tracks to complete an album for release in time to debut at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival. In early April 2001, the band tracked another five songs, and The Black Bear Sessions was completed. It was released to the public in June 2001, just one week before their appearance at Telluride.

      "Big Black's aggressive and abrasive music was characterized by distinctively clanky guitars and the use of a drum machine rather than a drum kit, elements that foreshadowed industrial rock. The band's lyrics flouted commonly held taboos and dealt frankly—and often explicitly—with politically and culturally loaded topics including murder, rape, child sexual abuse, arson, racism, and misogyny. Though the band's lyrics contained controversial material, the lyrics were meant to serve as a commentary or a display of distaste for the subject matter. They were staunchly critical of the commercial nature of rock, shunning the mainstream music industry and insisting on complete control over all aspects of their career. At the height of their success, they booked their own tours, paid for their own recordings, refused to sign contracts, and eschewed many of the traditional corporate trappings of rock bands. In doing so, they had a significant impact on the aesthetic and political development of independent and underground rock music.\n",

      "Charles Bronson borrowed from the early powerviolence of Infest, who blended youth crew hardcore with the velocity and dissonance of thrashcore. Songs were very brief, and sometimes punctuated by samples taken from various media (including Charles Bronson films). Lyrically, the group tended towards satirical commentary on the hardcore punk scene. The group has been described as a \"fast, screaming mess of tall, skinny guys with a lot to say (which you would only know if you read the liner notes)\". The group was sometimes criticized for its conceptual take on hardcore and art school tendencies, maintaining a long-standing feud with Felix Havoc of Code 13.\n",
      "The Effigies' website states that they were one of the first punk bands in Chicago. This might be a complicated claim for a band not formed until 1980, but true in the sense that the Midwest resisted punk and was late to discover or appreciate it to any degree. In the years immediately after The Ramones and The Sex Pistols first released records (1977), Chicago remained dominated by classic rock, disco and blues; punk bands were anathema to the Midwest rock establishment and had few places to play and fans had few places to hear live bands. Despite revisionistic claims in its later advertised station history, even Chicago's \"progressive\" radio station, WXRT, was never very supportive of punk or even new wave, outside a few efforts of a couple of DJs relegated to late night slots. What most punk fans recall as the first \"scene\" in Chicago did not rise until the very early 1980s, when clubs like Oz and O’Banion’s started to provide venues for live punk. In a 1999 retrospective about the 1985 music year, Chicago Sun-Times music writer Jim Derogatis termed the heyday of The Effigies \"the second generation of Midwestern punks,\" but this is correct only in describing the burgeoning young 1985 Midwest punk scene as it overtook the smaller, older scene which had cloistered itself in punk discos like La Mere Vipere and for all its excesses was musically passive, generating no bands and creating no music. By 1985,The Effigies, Naked Raygun, Strike Under and Big Black had been around for half a decade. There were no active punk bands in Chicago before them.\n",
      "The Fighters was formed in 1993 by Jason Mojica, Paul Koob, Mike McKee, and Don Shrader. The four had met while attending St. Joseph High School in Westchester, Illinois, where they collaborated on self-published comic books and zines under the monikers Rocco Comics, and Rocco Publishing. The world of small-press comics and zines that was cataloged at the time by Factsheet Five also served as the gateway for the group to other subcultures, including DIY punk rock. Unfortunately, just as the group's interest in punk rock was forming, they left for their first year of college: Koob and McKee were based in Chicago at DePaul University, while Mojica and Shrader were 350 miles away at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. Undeterred by distance, the four decided to form The Fighters halfway into that first school year, and used available technology to help with long-distance songwriting: \"Mojica would call up Koob and hum a melody, Koob would process the murmuring into a guitar riff and the two would have a jam session over the phone\" reported the Daily Egyptian. When summer finally rolled around, The Fighters had their first in-person practice session and recorded and released their first 7\" EP, Give 'em the Business–the first release under the spinoff Rocco Records imprint–just a month later. Give 'em the Business received a positive review from the grandfather of punk rock, Maximum Rocknroll founder Tim Yohannan. Yohannan would later entrust the third edition of the DIY resource guide Book Your Own Fuckin' Life to Mojica and the Rocco team, which included The Fighters. Mojica and Yohannan bonded over an earnest love for the punk scene and its DIY ethos as well as a shared a workaholic streak. \"What drives so many people to work their asses off to the extent of becoming total maniacs in this wacky world we call punk?\" Mojica was quoted as saying in Underground: The Subterranean Culture of DIY Punk Shows. \"Satisfaction, belonging, 'fame', the desire to escape ordinary life, and just plain fun are a few of the reasons,\" he continues, \"but it all comes down to love.\"\n",
      "In 2006, the members of a straight edge punk band called Few and the Proud started a \"side project-slash-joke\" band to have fun playing short-and-fast powerviolence songs influenced by Crossed Out and Infest. Harm's Way drummer Chris Mills commented on the band's early days and progression, stating: \"We'd play super fast powerviolence songs, and our singer would put on a mask and sing silly lyrics about beating up frat boys or whatever. Then, later as the band became more serious, we retired a lot of those elements and went in a more death metal direction—darker and less ridiculous, even if some aspects of it still weren't 100 percent serious.\" Harm's Way released several albums, EPs and singles through Organized Crime Records and Closed Casket Activities in their early days.\n",

Although American punk is generally considered to have started four or five years earlier, punk and new wave music arrived in Chicago far later than on either coast, so that Strike Under is correctly still considered an \"early\" Chicago punk band. They can also be seen as one of the first and most important bands of the \"second wave\" of Chicago punk, as it turned toward a more hardcore scene and sound, and as an archetype of Chicago hardcore.\n",

Accompanying him were Mark Tootle on guitar and keyboards, Jan Eric Volz on bass guitar, and Mark Proctor on drums. They were occasionally joined by singer Sharon McCall and guitarist Jimmy A.

      "The members of the band, without a name, played informally together and attended The Church on the Way in Van Nuys, California, where they met 2nd Chapter of Acts, who also attended there. They chose their name because of a sermon by Pastor Jack W. Hayford describing David as a man after God's heart, as seeking God's heart was an important motivation of the members of the band.

      "Code of Ethics formed in the early '90s with Barry Blaze and Eric Switzer. The duo released Visual Paradox as a self-published project, which was later picked up by indie label R.E.X. Records in 1991. In the early 1990s, the band's music was quite unique in that they were one of the few Christian music artists performing a Europop style. With their early sound being largely reminiscent of New Order, their later works became simultaneously more progressive and more tame in nature. Many fans believe their mid-1990s pop-leanings were forced by their involvement with major label ForeFront Records, as evidenced by the underground release of an industrial-leaning mix of the \"Satellite Babies\" project which was obscured by the mainstream release of the same recording in tamed-down form.\n",

Formerly an acoustic outfit, the group eventually switched to a more rock-oriented sound after Josh's brother, Caleb, joined the band.

The album was widely described as essentially a clone of the Red Hot Chili Peppers or Janes Addiction. They subsequently toured nationally with bands such as Scaterd Few and played festivals including the Cornerstone Festival. The band found their own groove by their second album, MagentaMantaLoveTree. Magenta was co-produced with Gene Eugene and is considered more emotional than their first. The bands' sound fuses punk rock and freestyle jazz to create their own brand of neo-psychedelic rock, as in the songs \"Black-Eyed Pea\" and \"Secret.\" They also covered Steve Taylor's \"I Want To Be A Clone\" for the 1994 tribute I Predict A Clone.

Determined to creating music that would touch people's souls, they bought a small home in Phoenix, Arizona, and became roommates. They filled the house with more musical equipment than furniture, and produced more music than meals, soon turning the small home into \"the\" loft studio. A short 2 years later, the band hit the road in support of their debut album, I'll Tell The World. Playing in over 250 shows across America, they quickly gathered a group of devoted fans, with 3 songs from their album going into the 'top-twenty rock single' list, and the album selling over 20,000 units. With the money made from the touring, Ever Stays Red managed to fund a trip to Belo Horizonte, Brazil, where they performed nightly for thousands of young Brazilian teens, many of which lived in the inner city. Throughout that 12-day stretch of shows, the band witnessed firsthand the power the music had to transcend culture and creed, making them even more certain of their calling.\n",

The band has stated that the name \"Fono\" has no significance; in an interview, Currie said \"It means absolutely nothing\".  Following the name change, the group was featured in Kerrang! magazine as one of their Best Unsigned Bands. Not long after, they did sign with a label, and the group released their debut full-length, Goesaroundcomesaround, in 1999. Album reviewers noted the album's American, as opposed to British, rock sound and the group's general appeal to audiences outside the world of Christian rock.

They have also been classified as a Christian rock act due to the individual band members' religious beliefs, frequent themes of Christianity in their lyrics, their association with the predominantly Christian Tooth & Nail Records label, and their performances at Christian-themed festivals such as Cornerstone. Despite these associations, the group has claimed not to be an explicitly Christian band, but rather a rock band with Christian members.\n",

Following In the Wake of Poseidon (1970) and the less successful chamber jazz-inspired Lizard (1970), and Islands (1971), the group reformatted and changed their instrumentation (swapping out saxophone in favour of violin and unusual percussion) in order to develop their own take on European rock improvisation, reaching a new creative peak on Larks' Tongues in Aspic (1973), Starless and Bible Black (1974) and Red (1974). Fripp disbanded the group in 1974.\n",
      "The band were formed after Maggie Bell was introduced to Les Harvey by his elder brother Alex Harvey. After playing together in the Kinning Park Ramblers, their next band Power was renamed Stone the Crows (after a British/Australian English exclamation of surprise or shock) by Led Zeppelin's manager, Peter Grant.  The band was co-managed by Grant and Mark London. London was associated with Lulu as the co-writer of her signature song, \"To Sir With Love\" and was also married to Lulu's manager, Marion Massey. London had also managed the predecessor band Cartoone, in which Peter Grant had a financial interest and featured Les Harvey on guitar.\n",
      "The name Pentangle was chosen to represent the five members of the band, and is also the device on Sir Gawain's shield in the Middle English poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight which held a fascination for Renbourn.\n",
      "The band was founded in 1969 by twin brothers Colin and Stewart Goldring, who were joined by drummer Nigel Pegrum from Spice (the band that would later evolve into Uriah Heep) and Peter \"Mars\" Cowling on bass. John Earle joined the band on sax and flute for their second album.  They came up with the strange band name by reversing and slightly rearranging the brothers' surname, adding in an extra 'o'.  In May 1972, the British music magazine NME reported that Gnidrolog was to appear at the Great Western Express Lincoln Festival on 26 May that year.  Other acts to perform in the Giants of Tomorrow marquee included Budgie, Skin Alley, Tea & Symphony, John Martyn, and Warhorse.  In 1972, Gnidrolog released both their first and second albums, In Spite of Harry's Toe-Nail and Lady Lake, before disbanding due to a lack of commercial success.  Despite having played gigs with fairly well known acts such as David Bowie,  Colosseum, King Crimson, Gentle Giant, Wishbone Ash, Soft Machine, and Magma in their brief career, they have always remained relatively obscure.\n",
      "Never a very commercially successful band, Stud had its biggest successes in Germany.\n",
      "The group that would become Funkadelic was formed by George Clinton in 1964, as the unnamed backing section for his doo wop group The Parliaments while on tour. The band originally consisted of musicians Frankie Boyce, Richard Boyce, and Langston Booth plus the five members of the Parliaments on vocals. Boyce, Boyce, and Booth enlisted in the Army in 1966, and Clinton recruited bassist Billy Bass Nelson and guitarist Eddie Hazel in 1967, then added guitarist Tawl Ross and drummer Tiki Fulwood. The name \"Funkadelic\" was coined by Nelson after the band relocated to Detroit. By 1968, because of a dispute with Revilot, the record company that owned \"The Parliaments\" name, the ensemble began playing under the name Funkadelic.\n",
      "The group has no relation to the British band of the same name formed in 1968, who recorded two albums for United Artists Records in the UK.\n",
      "In 1970 the band recorded their first album, Third World War, which was released in 1971 on Fly Records. Largely, the themes of the album espoused Marxist political sentiment. It featured Stamp on rhythm guitar and vocals, Avery on bass, Mick Lieber on lead guitars and Fred Smith (drums). Tony Ashton also added piano on some of the tracks, and Jim Price (trumpet and trombone) and Bobby Keyes (saxophone), American musicians who were playing with the Rolling Stones, provided some horn parts.\n",

      "According to vocalist Ernie Sorrentino, he was asked to provide a lead vocal for the Lanny Lambert and Bobby Flax song, \"White Lies, Blue Eyes,\" which had been recorded with studio instrumentalists some weeks before with Flax and Lambert singing harmony vocals. The producers, satisfied with the result, asked Sorrentino to record \"Changes of Mind\" for the B side, a song that he and drummer Mike Micara had written for their current band. The record was released on the Big Tree Records label under the name \"Bullet\" in December 1971. As \"White Lies\" quickly ran up the charts, guitarist Paul Granato was recruited along with keyboard/trumpet player Roget Pontbriand, and other members of the New York band Riverside Drive, to fill out a touring band. Pontbriand relates that \"a booking agent named John Apostle was asked to put a band together. At that time, I had been playing with Joey Stann and the late George Ruiz at an upper-Manhattan club called Churchill's Plum. John knew us and asked us to be part of Bullet along with Sorrentino and a drummer named Mike Micara. ... We shot the promotional photos for Bullet in Central Park the day after we met Ernie.\" The new band appeared on American Bandstand on March 11, 1972 performing \"White Lies\" and \"Willpower Weak, Temptation Strong.\"\n",
      "They had one single \"Find My Way Back Home\" that was released by RCA and reviewed by John Peel in Sounds.\n",
      "String Driven Thing formed in Glasgow in 1967 as a three part harmony folk band with the Adamses and guitarist John Mannion. After paying their dues on the Scottish folk circuit they put out an eponymous album on the independent Concord label (copies of which are collectable and difficult to find) although a long way from their later Charisma label output. The group moved to London in 1972 and Chris Adams began to steer the band towards the electric folk-rock genre where his song writing abilities, which often feature hard-bitten and bitter observations capturing the harsher side of life, would be seen to better effect. By 1972 he had recruited classically trained violinist Graham Smith and guitarist Colin Wilson on bass, but soon afterwards Mannion left, citing musical differences.\n",
      "The group was assembled by guitarist Vincent McCusker in early 1971 in Belfast, and consisted primarily of classically trained musicians Peter Farrelly (bass guitar and lead vocals), Stephen Houston (keyboards and oboe), and Martin Foye (drums and percussion). After two years of performing, they created a demo tape, and were signed by Pye Records for their underground music and progressive rock label Dawn Records. Between 1973 and 1975, the group released four studio albums and three singles. Despite having played hundreds of concerts in the United Kingdom and mainland Europe during that time, no live output had yet been released, although audience bootleg recordings of live shows in England and Ireland do exist. A concert at the Friars Aylesbury club played on 6 December 1975 was recorded using a mobile unit for a possible album Live at Friars Aylesbury, but the master tapes were later destroyed by fire in a flat the musicians shared in Peckham, London.\n",

      "The JSD Band formed in 1969 and derived its name from the first letter of the first name of each of its three founding members: Jim Divers, Sean O’Rourke, and Des Coffield. Chuck Fleming and Colin Finn also joined the group rounding out the five-member lineup. Additionally, fiddle player Lindsay Scott temporarily filled in for Chuck Fleming in 1972.\n",
      "In 2017, Beckett songwriter Brian Ingham sued Iron Maiden for copyright infringement over two popular songs, \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" and \"The Nomad\", which lifted musical sections and lyrics from the song \"Life's Shadow\". Iron Maiden manager Rod Smallwood was the agent for Beckett and a teenage Steve Harris saw the band play this song live. Harris and Dave Murray settled with one of the credited songwriters, Robert Barton. Ingham was unaware of the matter until 2011 and Barton claimed to be the sole songwriter during the original settlement. Iron Maiden stopped performing Hallowed Be Thy Name on their 2017 tour as a result. The issue was settled out of court in March 2018.\n",
      "The band's lineup consisted of co-founders Rinus Gerritsen (bass and keyboards) and George Kooymans (vocals and guitar), along with Barry Hay (vocals, guitar, flute and saxophone), and Cesar Zuiderwijk (drums and percussion). All musicians in the last lineup of the band have been continuous members of the band since 1970, although other musicians have joined and left the band during the intervening years.\n",
      "PFM introduced new sounds, such as the synthesizer, to the Italian musical world.  They were also among the first to combine symphonic classical and traditional Italian musical influences in a rock music context.

      "Vander created a fictional language, Kobaïan, in which most lyrics are sung. In a 1977 interview with Vander and long-time Magma vocalist Klaus Blasquiz, Blasquiz said that Kobaïan is a \"phonetic language made by elements of the Slavonic and Germanic languages to be able to express some things musically. The language has of course a content, but not word by word.\" Vander himself has said, \"When I wrote, the sounds  came naturally with it—I didn't intellectualise the process by saying 'Ok, now I'm going to write some words in a particular language', it was really sounds that were coming at the same time as the music.\" Later albums tell different stories set in more ancient times; however, the Kobaïan language remains an integral part of the music.\n",
      "Their sound has been described as psychedelic folk rock, progressive folk and psychedelic pop, characterized by male/female harmonies. With the encouragement of David Crosby, they were signed personally by Ahmet Ertegun, managed by David Geffen and Elliot Roberts, and recorded their first album produced by Stephen Barncard in the space of one month. The album was shelved two months later due to management malfunction and was never released.\n",
      "Initially signing to a Dutch record company, SI Music, then forming their own label, Synergy Records, the band have established themselves within the world of progressive rock, though their style may also extend into album-oriented rock, melodic rock, hard rock and even a slightly jazz edge.\n",

They released their debut album, Beyond the Wandering Moon, in 1997 on Hammerheart Records (now Karmageddon Media), and toured that year with black metal bands Emperor and Limbonic Art through Europe. Their second album, ...And So the Night Became was released in 1998, accompanied by a tour supporting Deicide, and was later re-released in several different formats.\n",
      "The band began in September 1995, when guitarist Sathonys and drummer Matthias got together to assemble a dominant death metal band with harmonic arrangements (melodic death metal). They put adverts in several music magazines in the hopes that they would find suitable musicians to play with them. In answer to the advertisement, they were joined by bassist Marko Thomas and keyboardist and vocalist Vlad Dracul. The last member of their initial formation was the second guitarist, Hyperion, who joined them by the end of that year. With this formation the band recorded the Carpe Noctem demo tape, which received fair reviews from the German specialized press. It also attracted the attention of one of Century Media's executives, who began keeping track of the band.\nAgathodaimon then proceeded to play minor gigs and support some European bands. Eventually, they received an offer from Century Media to fund the recording of their second demo. This demo was recorded in early 1997 and was named Near Dark. It attracted the interest of quite a few recording labels, and in the end the band opted to sign with Nuclear Blast.\nAfter successfully composing the songs for their debut album Blacken the Angel, one of the members of Agathodaimon, Vlad, was forced to quit the band due to problems with immigration. After returning to his native Romania, he was denied re-entry in Germany. The situation involved the fact that he had left the country during Nicolae Ceaușescu's regime. The band therefore was forced to make use of guest musicians to record their debut. Akaias (from Asaru) did the vocals and Marcel \"Vampallens\" (from Nocte Obducta) took the role of the keyboards. Vlad's participation on the album was restricted to the solo song \"Contemplation Song\", which was sent to the band via air mail.\nThe CD caused some impact, and Agathodaimon proceeded to tour with bands such as Children of Bodom and Hypocrisy. At the height of the album's success they opened gigs for Dimmu Borgir, Lacrimosa and other bands.\nIn 1999, Vampallens decided to quit the band in order to dedicate himself fully to his main project Nocte Obducta. He was replaced by female keyboardist Christine S. \nTo record their second album - Higher Art of Rebellion - the band travelled to Romania, in order to be able to play together with Vlad. The vocalist Akaias also participated in the recording of this album, as well as singer Dan Byron performing clean vocals. Recordings took place at Magic Sound in Bucharest. A European tour as headliner with Graveworm and Siebenbürgen followed.\nAfter a short hiatus, the band recorded the album Chapter III in 2001 at the Kohlekeller Studio in Germany.\nSome changes to the band's structure followed, with Vlad definitely quitting the band, soon followed by Marko and Christine. \nMarko did leave because of health problems and quit making music, while Christine formed her own band Demonic Symphony, where she handles bass guitar and vocals. Marko and Christine were replaced by Darin Smith and Felix Ü. Walzer.\nIn 2004 the band released the album Serpent's Embrace, which again was recorded at Kohlekeller Studio with Kristian Kohlmannslehner as producer. \nIn early 2006 personal differences led to the split of Eddy and the rest of the band. A new bass player named Till (formerly active in Misanthropic, where Matthias also played drums for a while) joined the ranks, and the song writing for the next album took place. Singer, guitarist Frank \"Akaias\" Nordmann left in January 2007 to carry on with other musical interests.\n",
      "The band formed in 1987 with the name Fourth Reich, playing death metal. The initial line-up was War D. on guitar, Zumof on vocals, Acronoise on drums, and Masmiseim (b. Christophe Mermod, Acronoise's brother) on bass. In 1989 Fourth Reich changed name to Alastis, a derivation of Alastor, the executioner of hell, and moved towards black metal; two years later Masmiseim left in order to join Samael, with Zumof departing soon after. Samael’s current vocalist/guitarist Vorph did guest vocals on one track from the demo Black Wedding, and the band issued their debut album, The Just Law, on Head Not Found. After several more line-up changes, they signed to Adipocere Records, who issued their second album, ...And Death Smiled, in 1995. The same year, Alastis toured with bands Anathema and Theatre of Tragedy in support of the album.\n",

Since 2013, the band has consisted of Ian, drummer Charlie Benante, bassist Frank Bello, vocalist Joey Belladonna and lead guitarist Jonathan Donais. Ian and Benante (who replaced one-time drummer Greg D'Angelo in 1983) are the only two members to appear on every album, while Bello has been a member of Anthrax since 1984, replacing original bassist Dan Lilker.

      "Until the late 1990s, the band played a traditional black metal style with heathen lyrical content, but soon changed to that of occult and thelemic themes written by their lead vocalist Nergal and Krzysztof Azarewicz. With the 1999 release of Satanica, the band demonstrated their presence in the death metal scene, while retaining their own signature style characterized by the drum work of Inferno and multi-layered vocals. Despite Behemoth having been labeled as death metal or thrash metal-influenced, Nergal has mentioned that he does not like the band to be labeled.\n",
      "Bethlehem was formed by Jürgen Bartsch in 1991. They recorded a few demos in the early 90s before releasing their debut album \"Dark Metal\" in 1994, which featured Andreas Classen on vocals. On their second full-length album Dictius Te Necare (Latin: You must/should kill yourself), Classen was replaced with Rainer Landfermann on vocals (known as the bass player in the German death metal band Pavor). Landfermann's vocals were particularly extreme, described by critics and fans alike as \"one of the sickest and most extreme voices you'll ever hear from a human being\". On S.U.I.Z.I.D. his place is taken by Marco Kehren from the band Deinonychus. Guido Meyer de Voltaire, the vocalist from Schatten aus der Alexander Welt and Mein Weg, is also well known with his band Aardvarks. Andreas Classen, vocalist on Dark Metal also did vocals for Shining (primary vocalist Niklas Kvarforth also provided vocals for Bethlehem on the album A Sacrificial Offering to the Kingdom of Heaven in a Cracked Dog's Ear), Dark Creation (German band), Paragon Belial, Made of Iron, Kadathorn, Darkened Nocturn Slaughtercult. Over the years Bethlehem modernized their style and so the early black and doom metal influences are now hardly present, the band favouring a more Neue Deutsche Härte (New German Hardness) and electronic approach. In 1998 Bethlehem collaborated on the soundtrack for the American underground movie Gummo with the tracks \"Schuld Uns'res Knöcherigen Faltpferds\" and \"Verschleierte Irreligiösität\".\n",

In 2008 they released the Razor to Oblivion EP under their own label, Hot Mass Records. The EP gained attention in the local music underground and the band signed with Southern Lord Records, a Los Angeles based metal and hardcore punk oriented label, in October 2009. Black Breath toured across the country to support the EP as a support act for Victims, Rise and Fall, and Trap Them. Southern Lord then took over the distribution of the EP, which was re-released under the new label, and Black Breath went to the east coast to record their debut album, Heavy Breathing, at GodCity Studios, owned by Converge guitarist Kurt Ballou. Heavy Breathing was released on March 30, 2010 by Southern Lord. Their second album titled Sentenced To Life was released March 27, 2012 also on Southern Lord Records.\nIn October 2014 it was announced that Black Breath would be returning to GodCity Studios to record their follow up, Slaves Beyond Death, for an early 2015 release. Elijah Nelson, the band's bassist, was found dead on December 29th, 2019.\n",
      "Their music included elements of various extreme metal styles. Their earlier music was mostly classified as thrash metal and black metal with an experimental streak, while their last album was more akin to doom metal and gothic metal. Celtic Frost were inspired by metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Venom as well as gothic rock groups like Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Christian Death and by the hardcore punk of Discharge.\n",
      "Converge have enjoyed a relatively high level of recognition. According to AllMusic, they are \"regarded as one of the most original and innovative bands to emerge from the punk underground.\" Their popularity rose with the release of Jane Doe, which was ranked as the best album of the decade by Sputnikmusic, the best album of 2001 by Terrorizer and later as the 61st best metal album of all time by Rolling Stone. Subsequently, Converge moved from Equal Vision Records to the considerably larger label Epitaph Records and their records gradually became more elaborate and expensive to produce. Special releases have traditionally been handled by Deathwish Inc., established by Bannon in 1999. The band's ninth studio album, The Dusk in Us, was released in November 2017 through Deathwish and Epitaph.\n",

After using a number of temporary vocalists for their initial shows, the band eventually recruited L.G. Petrov, who was the drummer for the band Morbid, which featured Mayhem vocalist Dead. The band also recruited Morbid's session guitarist Uffe Cederlund as a second guitarist, and recorded a number of demos with tracks that would eventually appear on Entombed's debut album. Following increased tensions between band members, the majority of the band decided to rename themselves as Entombed rather than force these members out.\n",

      "Gorgoroth was founded in 1992 by guitarist Infernus. In 1993, the band released their first demo, entitled A Sorcery Written in Blood. On January 7, 1994, Firda, the major newspaper in the county of Sogn og Fjordane where the band originated from, ran a cover story on the demo, with the headline \"Local music with Satanic symbolism\". According to the article, the release of the demo and flyers with Satanic symbols led to \"concerned parents contacting the Sheriff's Office in Fjaler\". After the demo was released, Gorgoroth signed a record deal with Embassy Productions and started work on their debut full-length Pentagram. When bassist Kjettar left the band in 1993, Samoth of Emperor joined Gorgoroth as their new bassist, and participated in the recording of the album. After Pentagram was completed and released in 1994, drummer Goat left the band and was replaced by Frost from Satyricon. The band performed their first concert at Lusa Lottes Pøbb in Oslo, Norway, on May 3, 1994, at a four-day Black Metal Nights festival with bands such as Dark Funeral (who also made their live debut), Dissection, Enslaved, Marduk (who played their first gig abroad), Gehenna and Hades Almighty.\n",
      "High on Fire was founded in 1998 by Sleep guitarist Matt Pike, drummer Des Kensel, and bassist George Rice (from Dear Deceased, who originally auditioned to be the band's vocalist).

      "Kataklysm was formed in Montreal, Quebec in September 1991. At the beginning of their career, they were known for their fast and technical brand of death metal, known as the \"Northern Hyperblast\". Nuclear Blast Records soon took notice of the band in 1992 after noticing the band's debut demo The Death Gate Cycle of Reincarnation, which gained significant praise from the underground metal scene. In 1994, Kataklysm signed to Nuclear Blast and released their first EP The Mystical Gate of Reincarnation, followed by their debut album Sorcery in 1995. This was followed in 1996 by their second full-length album Temple of Knowledge, which they accompanied with their first music video for the album's track, \"The Awakener\". Following the release of this album however, founding member and lead vocalist Sylvain Houde departed from the band. This, as Houde himself confessed, was due to the emotional effects surrounding the end of his romantic relationship. Subsequently, the band's bassist Maurizio Iacono replaced Houde as vocalist, ceding his duties as bassist to Stephane Barbe. The band's musical direction shifted from being primarily spearheaded by Houde to both Iacono and founding guitarist JF Dagenais instead.\n",
      "The band released two more albums, Discouraged Ones (1998) and Tonight's Decision (1999), before settling into a stable quintet lineup for all of the 2000s. The band released four more albums with said lineup: Last Fair Deal Gone Down (2001), Viva Emptiness (2003), The Great Cold Distance (2006), and Night Is the New Day (2009), with the band slowly moving away from their metal sound while adding more progressive rock sounds to their work over time. While lineup changes started up again into the 2010s, Renkse and Nyström persisted, and the band continued on to release their ninth and tenth studio albums, Dead End Kings (2012) and  The Fall of Hearts (2016). After touring in support of the album through 2017, the band entered a hiatus at the beginning of 2018.

Their first album, entitled Greater Art, was released through the record label Black Mark Production in 1994. The album is doom metal featuring coarse, ragged vocals and crushing guitars. The band would subsequently steer away from such a directly categorized style, only revisiting it on their 2011 release Illwill.\n",
      "The band's origins are based in the New Orleans based band Oz which guitarist Steve Blaze joined in the early 80s, which included Rick Bohrer on vocals, Orlando \"Ace\" Palacio on guitar, Michael \"Maxx\" Darby on bass guitar, and Jeff Savelle on drums. When Palacio quit, the band told Blaze that he was the new lead guitarist. The band played gigs under the Oz moniker until Blaze came up with the name Lillian Axe driving home from seeing the movie Creepshow. Blaze was inspired by a scene in the movie where a skeleton in a bridesmaid dress was floating in a window. The name \"Lillian\" came to mind as a \"creepy sounding, old lady name\" along with the word Axe to complete the name. Blaze noted, \"“So, it’s like a skeleton with a veil, and it inspired me. What would that apparition’s name be? Some creepy old lady’s name, so the name Lillian came to mind. I was sitting at the red light on the corner of Houma Boulevard and Veterans when I immediately thought ‘Lillian Axe.’”\n",
      "Meshuggah has become known for their innovative musical style and their complex, polymetered song structures and polyrhythms. They rose to fame as a significant act in extreme underground music, became an influence for modern metal bands, and gained a cult following. The band was labelled as one of the ten most important hard rock and heavy metal bands by Rolling Stone and as the most important band in metal by Alternative Press.

Each album has some concept related to two extremes: a meeting of East and West, past and present, light and darkness, and God and Satan.\n",
      "The band formed in 1997 after the break-up of a short-lived political hardcore band, Treblinka, with 2 former members of said band, vocalist J. R. Hayes (Enemy Soil), guitarist Scott Hull (Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Japanese Torture Comedy Hour, ex-Anal Cunt), and drummer John Evans, who left the band for an unspecified school not long after the band's formation. After the departure of Evans, he was soon replaced by Brian Harvey.\n",
      "The first incarnation of the band was under the name Aslan, after a character in the novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C. S. Lewis.  With money earned from local shows and T-shirt sales, they recorded a self-titled demo tape in 1986. The European Metal tape trading community took notice of the demo and the band received some enthusiastic reviews from fanzines and from German metal fans. After discovering another band with the same name, they changed theirs to Psychotic Waltz and recorded a new four-song demo in 1988. This new demo also found its way to the European Metal tape trading community and the band began to build their loyal European fanbase.\n",

      "In the Jazz Age and during the 1930s, \"all-girl\" bands such as the Blue Belles, the Parisian Redheads (later the Bricktops), Lil-Hardin's All-Girl Band, the Ingenues, the Harlem Playgirls led by the likes of Neliska Ann Briscoe and Eddie Crump, the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, Phil Spitalny's Musical Sweethearts, \"Helen Lewis and Her All-Girl Jazz Syncopators\" as well as \"Helen Lewis and her Rhythm Queens   were popular. Dozens of early sound films were made of the vaudeville style all-girl groups, especially short subject promotional films for Paramount and Vitaphone. (In 1925, Lee de Forest filmed Lewis and her band in his short-lived Phonofilm process, in a film now in the Maurice Zouary collection at the Library of Congress.) Blanche Calloway, sister of Cab Calloway, led a male band, Blanche Calloway and Her Joy Boys, from 1932 to 1939, and Ina Ray Hutton led an all-girl band, the Melodears, from 1934 to 1939. Eunice Westmoreland, under the name Rita Rio, led an all-girl band appearing on NBC Radio and in short subjects for Vitaphone and RKO before changing her career to acting and her professional name to Dona Drake, appearing in numerous 1940s movies. Ivy Benson's \"All Girls Band\" was the BBC's resident dance band in 1943 and toured until the 1980s. All-girl bands active in vaudeville, variety shows, and early sound films during the 1920s to the 1950s are documented by Kristin McGee in Some Liked it Hot: Jazz Women in Film and Television. Sally Placksin, Linda Dahl, D. Antoinette Handy, and Frank Driggs along with professor Sherrie Tucker, in her book Swing Shift: \"All-Girl\" Bands of the 1940s, have also documented this era. A Polish group Filipinki was established in 1959.\n",
      "Cover bands play several types of venues.  When a band is starting out, they might play private parties and fundraisers, often for little or no money, or in return for food and bar privileges, although many professional musicians refuse to do this.  With enough experience, a band will begin to \"play out\" professionally at bars and night clubs. Some cover bands are made up of full-time professional musicians. These bands are usually represented by an entertainment agency.\n",

      "The band first formed in a run-down music house that was going to be demolished during their time there. According to the band there were mice running on the floor and the pipes were frozen.

Anna and Emelie followed shortly and Gothenburg opened up some new opportunities for them, the city providing a larger scene and audience.\n",
      "Afrirampo's music often features call and response vocals, catchy distorted pop melodies, looping fret noise, droning feedback, guttural barks and impromptu squealing. Their early albums featured a sound that could be described as noise-punk, albeit with surprisingly melodic vocal parts, along with some longer, less melodic improvised jam pieces.  Their later albums, especially Suuto Breakor and We Are Uchu No Ko, featured a much more expansive sound, sometimes with very long songs and quieter, more ethereal passages.  The band's later albums featured noticeable elements of African music, with a tribal percussive sound and call-and-response vocals.  This derived in part from a 2004 stay with pygmy tribes in Cameroon documented on their 2006 album Baka Ga Kita.\n",

After some personnel changes and more rehearsing, the band sustained many comparisons to the Go-Go's, who were popular at the time as well assigned to the same label, IRS Records. However, American Girls featured veterans of the all-women band scene including Brie Howard who had played drums for Fanny and Miiko Watanabe who played bass with the Screamin' Sirens.

Christie let Bratmobile borrow rehearsal space and equipment and advised them to listen to the Ramones for inspiration. In response to that advice, Wolfe states that \"Something in me clicked. Like, okay, if most boy punk rock bands just listen to the Ramones and that's how they write their songs, then we'll do the opposite and I won't listen to any Ramones and that way we'll sound different.\" With five original songs, the band played its first show as a two-woman act at Olympia's North Shore Surf Club on February 14, 1991, with Neuman and Wolfe sharing duties on guitar, drums, and vocals.

Lead singer Simon Ohlsson is usually very wild and erratic on stage and several performances have gone awry. For example, early in the band's career, a gig in Varberg ended with Simon being dragged away by police who thought he was on drugs (it is said that he had only had one beer); and at Rookiefestivalen 2004 he jumped out into the sparse crowd and was thrown out from the venue by a security guard, while the rest of the band kept playing.\n",

After several attempts at titling the new lineup, the name Gruntruck came to Ben while out record shopping.\n",

Danielson's band Bundle of Hiss played with Doyle's previous band (in which he played drums) H-Hour. Tad recruited drummer Steve Wied (formerly of Skin Yard) and guitarist Gary Thorstensen to complete the original lineup.

Their work from this era can best be characterized as aggressive rock with melodic undertones, or 'Southern rock' as Hennessy explained in an MTV interview.

The band signed a three-album deal with A&M Records during the height of the grunge wave, and released their first album, Dragline, in 1993. Their most well-known songs are from this period which received moderate rotation on the radio and on Headbanger's Ball, MTV's hard rock/heavy metal showcase.

The heavy metal record label Prosthetic Records saw Abasi's guitar work and asked him to create a solo album for them. Abasi initially declined, feeling such an endeavor would be \"...egotistical and unnecessary.\" Abasi decided to take a year off to study music, as he felt he was unable to reach his peak at guitar playing. After Abasi had completed his course, he took up the label on the offer of a solo project. The name Animals as Leaders was inspired by Daniel Quinn's 1992 novel Ishmael, which addresses anthropocentrism. Abasi coined the name as a reminder \"that we're all essentially animals\".\n",

According to Hill, they didn't always intend to remain a duo, though: \" had intentions to start a band that was like… kinda like what we were doing with just the two of us, but with more people. But, we couldn't find the other people so we decided to do it just with the two of us.\" Their name is simply a reference to the slang word \"hella\" that was common throughout Northern California.\n",

The duo formed a metal band in Houston that had trouble finding a bass guitarist and drummer. Letchford was set to attend the Los Angeles Musicians Institute a year after the band's formation, and Levrier decided to attend as well.

The band then signed to SCI Fidelity Records, debuting on the label with the live double album, Escaping Sargasso Sea, which was nominated for a Jammy award by Guitar Player magazine for \"Best Live Album of 2007\". The album was described by Relix magazine as \"sexy and sophisticated dance music, mature enough to be played in the club or the living room\". The band followed this with Copy/Paste/Repeat, an album of remixes of tracks from their previous two studio albums, by bands and producers including Lymbyc Systym, Juan Maclean, DJ Harry and Telepath. The album was positively received by PopMatters, who said \"Copy/Paste/Repeat reinvents the jam band’s music as dance floor jams, with hip hop and trance-influenced beats and mind-warping electronic synth burbles\".\n",
      "The original lineup of the Marshall Tucker Band, formed in 1972, included lead guitarist, steel guitarist, vocalist, and primary songwriter Toy Caldwell (1947–1993), lead vocalist Doug Gray (born 1948), keyboard player, saxophone player, and flautist Jerry Eubanks (born 1950), rhythm guitarist George McCorkle (1947–2007), drummer Paul Riddle (born 1953), and bassist Tommy Caldwell (1949–1980). They signed with Capricorn Records and released their first album in 1973, The Marshall Tucker Band.\n",
      "Max Creek was formed in 1971 when Hartt College of Music students Dave Reed (acoustic guitar) and John Rider (electric bass) met and shared their original songs and love of American folk music.  They initially rehearsed in the basement of John's frat house in Hartford, CT, but later moved to a 'band house' in Feeding Hills, MA.  Dave eventually asked his high school friend, drummer Bob Gosselin to join, making them a trio. The band originally played folk, singer/songwriter and country rock music. In 1972, Dave Reed invited one of his music students, 15-year-old electric guitarist Scott Murawski, to attend a rehearsal at the 'band house'.  Scott's playing blew the guys away and he was asked to come on board the MC train.  Strangely, Scott's early original association with the band ended abruptly when he was banned from a Hartford, CT club that the band played at regularly for \"being under age\". In 1973 Dave Reed came down with appendicitis, so Mark Mercier was brought in on keyboards to fill in, and Scott was invited back to play lead guitar. Due to the influence of the Grateful Dead, the band decided to incorporate more improvisation into the music becoming more electrified. The music of the psychedelic era had a heavy influence on the band, leading to a  sound and style more like that of the Grateful Dead and the rest of the San Francisco Bay scene. Eventually, Dave left the band to pursue bluegrass, country rock and acoustic ragtime music as a solo act and with the short-lived Hatchett Hill String Band.  In the '80s, Dave went on to form Tamboura Productions where he has recorded several albums and fronted a number of bands including Tamboura (1992) and The Introverts (2016); he is an avid builder/player of cigar box guitars.\n",

      "The early days of Mofro can be traced back to the mid-nineties when John Higginbotham aka \"JJ Grey\" and Daryl Hance signed with a United Kingdom label and played shows in Europe as Mofro Magic.  Grey and Hance met in their hometown of Jacksonville, Florida while working for an air conditioning company and developed a friendship through music. Their first band together was a rock band called Faith Nation followed by a funk band called Alma Zuma. The deal with the record label in London fell through, and Grey and Hance returned to their native Jacksonville and formed Mofro, then signed with Fog City Records in 2001.\n",

Their village, founded by the late Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, was and continues to be the birthplace of many Jewish songs enjoyed the world over. The members of the Moshav Band were under the spiritual guidance of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach while immersed in his musical world, often performing with him at his concerts.

      "The roots of the New Riders can be traced back to the early 1960s Peninsula folk/beatnik scene centered on Stanford University's now-defunct Perry Lane housing complex in Menlo Park, California, where future Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia often played gigs with like-minded guitarist David Nelson. The young John Dawson (also known as \"Marmaduke\") also played some concerts with Garcia, Nelson, and their compatriots while visiting relatives on summer vacation. Enamored of the sounds of Bakersfield-style country music, Dawson would turn his older friends on to the work of Merle Haggard and Buck Owens and provided a vital link between Timothy Leary's International Federation for Internal Freedom in Millbrook, New York (having boarded at the Millbrook School) and the Menlo Park bohemian coterie nurtured by Ken Kesey.\n",

Blown away by the project, Ferlino immediately moved to San Francisco and joined the band on-stage at the 2001 High Sierra Music Festival.  They have toured with many other bands including in 2005 as part of Big Summer Classic, with The String Cheese Incident as well as Umphrey's McGee, Yonder Mountain String Band, and Keller Williams.   They have shared the stage with a range of bands including Hot Buttered Rum String Band, ALO, moe., and Tea Leaf Green, and are incredibly talented at mixing and blending with many musical styles. They have had many special guests at their shows over the years, including Martin Fierro (saxophonist), violinist Tim Carbone from Railroad Earth, various members of The String Cheese Incident, Mark Karan, Steve Kimock, Mike Stern, and many others. They have recently released their fourth studio album, entitled New Monsoon V, which is a showcase of their diverse talents and was engineered by John Cutler, best known for his work with the Grateful Dead. As of April 2009 the band also released a live 2 disc set entitled New Monsoon LIVE which was recorded over a three night run in Dallas, Austin and Houston Texas.\n",
      "The Other Ones continued the musical legacy of the Grateful Dead after Jerry Garcia died in 1995, playing many Grateful Dead songs and utilizing a similar jam band style that emphasized musical improvisation.

Simmons died shortly after the formation of the band due to a sudden illness.  Guitarist Charlie Hitchcock joined shortly thereafter. Along with The Disco Biscuits, Sound Tribe Sector 9, and Lotus the group was among the first to blend rock, jazz, funk, and electronica into the milieu of what has been dubbed livetronica (a subgenre of the jam band movement where live bands blend the structures of DJ-produced sequenced electronic music into a more traditional live band setting). Prior to 2006, the band's repertoire consisted entirely of instrumental material.\n",

      "Pigeons Playing Ping Pong began in 2009. They released their first full-length album titled Funk E P in 2010. This album name is a play on words says vocalist/guitarist Greg Ormont, and unfortunately the name led people to think this first album was just an EP. In July 2014, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong released their second full-length album titled Psychology. Pigeons Playing Ping Pong has hosted Domefest every year since 2009. The location of the festival has changed periodically but is currently held at Marvin's Mountaintop in Masontown, WV. In a 2017 interview, Greg Ormont (vocals/guitar) said, \"We met in college at the University of Maryland and the dorm project turned into the real thing. We've been playing for over 8 years. We've been touring the country for 4–5 years and just having a blast spreading our high energy psychedelic funk and good vibes.

      "The Rhythm Devils had their origins as an informal but frequent fixture in the Grateful Dead concert repertoire starting in the mid-to-late 1970s, and continuing until the Grateful Dead's last concert in 1995. Most Grateful Dead concerts featured an extended segment during the 2nd set of improvisational drumming and percussion by Hart and Kreutzmann who took over the stage as a duo (with occasional guests).  This segment was variously known to fans as \"Rhythm Devils\", \"Drums\", or conversationally as \"the drums\", and was usually followed in post-1979 concerts by another extended improvisation by the rest of the band, usually without the drummers, which was known as \"Space\".  The \"Rhythm Devils\" segment of a Grateful Dead concert almost always segued out of a full-band song, and the \"Space\" segment almost invariably would segue into the beginnings of another full-band song as the drummers resumed their seats with the rest of the band.  The Grateful Dead album Dead Set has a characteristic example of a 1980 \"Rhythm Devils\" segment which is titled as such, and which is followed by a \"Space\" segment.\n",

      "The band was originally formed in 2001, and was composed of vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Todd Sheaffer, violinist/vocalist Tim Carbone, mandolinist John Skehan, multi-instrumentalist Andy Goessling, drummer/vocalist Carey Harmon, and bassist Dave Von Dollen. Though each member was aware of one another, it was only Todd, Tim, and Andy who had played together. Tim, had joined Todd's band From Good Homes on stage, in addition Tim and Andy having a 20-year friendship through their former bands, The Blue Sparks From Hell, and New Jersey rock outfit Kings in Disguise. When rehearsal's of original music, mostly written by Sheaffer, began occurring, the band soon realized that something musically unique was happening. After three weeks of rehearsing, they went into a local recording studio to track a five-song demo. Recorded live with no overdubs except backing vocals, this untitled demo set Railroad Earth's career in motion.  Within a week, they landed a slot at Telluride Bluegrass Festival, an appearance that was only the new band's tenth as Railroad Earth. The previous nine gigs had been little more than warm-ups at small North Jersey bars and Elks lodges and a couple of support slots for regional bands. Realizing immediately how strong the initial five-song demo was, the band decided to return to the same studio to cut another five tracks to complete an album for release in time to debut at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival. In early April 2001, the band tracked another five songs, and The Black Bear Sessions was completed. It was released to the public in June 2001, just one week before their appearance at Telluride. That album contains what are still some of the most popular songs in Railroad Earth's repertoire, including \"Seven Story Mountain,\" \"Head\" and, of course, \"Railroad Earth.\"\n",

Noting the Bandits' potential, a Los Angeles Times review of the album said \"Now comes a young, talented ska band, the Pharmaceutical Bandits. It would be OK with me if the Grinch spared them but swiped their ska records and left a shelf of Who, Clash, Bob Marley, Elvis Costello and Neil Young.\" Matt Embree attended Los Alamitos High School, which was an incubator for other third wave ska bands such as Reel Big Fish, Save Ferris, and The Scholars.\n",

They bonded over a shared love of punk rock and African music. Koenig toured with The Dirty Projectors during a period of experimentation with African music, inspiring the band to incorporate world sounds into their earliest work. The band chose the name \"Vampire Weekend\" from the title of a short film project Koenig worked on during the summer between freshman and sophomore years in college.

He played keyboards in his bedroom and, together with friend Bob Davis (later Chuck Wagon), created a type of music that Phillips describes as \"autism rock\", similar to Devo, though not as good. Another friend of Phillips was Steve Hufsteter, a former junior high school and high school class mate. The latter figure was the guitarist and main songwriter for local power pop band the Quick, and was giving guitar lessons to Stan Lee (born Stan Sobol).  Although Hufsteter thought highly of Phillips' keyboard playing, it was his opinion that Phillips becoming vocalist for the band Lee was starting would be good for his friend's social well being. Phillips intentionally sabotaged his first audition, but realizing his mistake, aggressively entreated Lee for another chance. That audition was successful, \"and the rest is history\" according to Stan Lee.

      "The band was founded by Quetzal Flores, with the intention of pushing the boundaries of Chicano music and is currently one of Los Angeles' most important and successful groups. They play a mix of Mexican and Afro-Cuban rhythms, jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock music, supercharged by the dynamic vocals of lead singer and composer Martha Gonzalez. Their commitment to using art as a tool for social change is informed and inspired by global grassroots movements. They have also been instrumental in developing Fandango Sin Fronteras, a dialog between Chicanos and Chicanas from California and Jarocho and Jarocha (musicians from Veracruz, Mexico). The band began in 1993 in a Chicano owned cafe, Troy cafe, in the Little Tokyo neighborhood of Los Angeles. Martha Gonzalez joined the group in 1995  They helped catalyze the Seattle Fandango Project in 2009 when Martha Gonzalez moved to Seattle to complete her PhD in Gender, Women & Sexuality Studies from the University of Washington.

Martha released her Fulbright research project Entre Mujeres:Feminine Translocal Music Composition, as a CD compilation. Martha Gonzalez who was born and raised in East Los Angeles joined the group shortly after it was formed.  Gonzalez grew up singing and learning the sentiment of Mexican music with her two siblings.  Encouraged by their father, the youthful trio sang with mariachi ensembles in the greater Los Angeles area.  Gonzalez completed her PhD in the Department of Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies at the University of Washington and as an undergraduate studied drumming and dance of Ghana and Cuba at UCLA.  Her musical background gave her a solid foundation to contribute as a performer, lyricist, and composer.  She affirms a strong female perspective in the group’s creative projects.  In her words, “part of being in the band is having a Chicana feminist analysis. The presence of women in the group is not ‘eye candy’ or a tokenized gesture toward balancing any sort of gender scale:  it’s an honest recognition of the poetic, musical, and compositional strengths the female musicians in the community possess.” A fan of old school artists, Martha cites some of her biggest influences in music are Chaka Khan, Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight and Joni Mitchell.\n",
      "The original line-up featured Rhoads and Garni with lead vocalist Kevin DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth, though that version of the band was mired by turmoil that would eventually see Garni fired for threatening to kill DuBrow.

After acquiring Gschoesser, Gilbert, with the help of Varney, recruited Jeff Martin of the Phoenix metal band Surgical Steel. Martin, who still lived in Phoenix and could not regularly write songs with Racer X in Los Angeles, began writing lyrics immediately for demo tapes that Gilbert had sent him.

Deney Terrio, host of Dance Fever, introduced Renegade in what is believed to be their first national television appearance as being from \"Whittier, California\". The band members were unusual in being ethnic Hispanics playing rock music, and this proved to be a barrier for Renegade during their early years.

In 1968, the Creators became Nightshift (named because Brown worked nights at a steel yard) and started performing with Deacon Jones, a football player and singer.\n",
      "The band is composed of brother and sister Neil and Becca Popkin, Matthew Bennett, and William Mohler. Neil and Becca originally hail from Boston, Matt was born in Hawaii, and William was born in Southern California. Recently, the band added longtime friend Ian Sterling Smith, formerly of Sleepmask, to play during live performances. The band was formed in Downtown Los Angeles in 2004 (according to their Myspace page), and they made their live debut in 2006. The band played anywhere they could get booked, including warehouse parties and small punk clubs, and also some higher profile venues like The Wiltern, the Bowery Ballroom and The Warfield. The band arguably played its biggest show in San Francisco in 2007, opening for the reformed Smashing Pumpkins at the Fillmore. According to Neil, it also marked a turning point in the band. He stated: \"...To see how hard they (Smashing Pumpkins) worked and how much they rehearsed, we decided we needed to step it up.\" After more touring and shows the band released a six-song, self-titled EP at the end of 2008.\n",
      "The band formed in 2004 when John Laux and Victor Mikhaltsevich met during high school. They shared a strong common interest in heavy metal and began writing instrumental songs together.  Eventually Victor introduced John Kevill to Laux as the new vocalist and immediately a strong creative partnership was forged. Originally they had named the band Onslaught but changed their name after realizing that there is a band using the same name. Nothing had been recorded and released while they had used the name. They soon recruited Andy Laux as the bassist and Evan Reiter as drummer. A few weeks later Reiter left and was replaced by Adam Carroll whom Kevill had met opening as a guitarist in a local band at a Metal Church show.\n",
      "To date, the band has released four studio albums: Exquisite Corpse (EP, 2008), The Fool (2010), Warpaint (2014), and Heads Up (2016).\n",
      "Floyd is also a notable engineer and producer and has worked with Bruce Dickinson, Halford, Earl Slick, Tribe of Gypsies, Rob Rock, downset, Godhead, Jake E. Lee, Ratt, Riot, Malice, Odin, World War III, Helstar, and Steel Prophet, among others. In addition, Floyd is the CEO of ElectroPhonic Innovations, a guitar company.\n",
      "Footage of the original lineup (1981-1983) can be seen in the film Slog Movie, which is a film documenting the Orange County punk scene.\n",
      "Founders of the band were the sisters Kristi and Kelly Callan—daughters of actress K Callan. The sisters formed their first group, The Undeclared, in 1979. The duo evolved into a trio, Goat Deity, in 1980, when they were joined by Steve Wynn. Wynn left to concentrate on his other band, The Dream Syndicate, and Kjehl Johansen (of The Urinals) joined on bass guitar, with the band name changing again to Narrow Adventure. With David Provost replacing Johansen in 1983, the band became Wednesday Week (named after the Undertones song), and they released their debut EP, Betsy's House, later that year. Further lineup changes followed, with Provost being replaced by Heidi Rodewald at the end of 1983, and Tom Alford joining on lead guitar in early 1984. In 1985, David Nolte (of The Last) replaced Alford, giving the band its most stable lineup.\n",
      "The band was formed in 1976 by singer John Denney and his guitarist brother Dix (sons of Hollywood actress Nora Denney), initially using the band names the Barbies and the Luxurious Adults. The Weirdos were originally a 1950s-inspired hard rock and roll band that, like the Ramones in New York City, predated the UK punk scene. While initially trying to distance themselves from the genre name \"punk\" that was created in New York, ultimately the band, in the words of John Denney, \"just kinda became more like this punk ROCK N ROLL type thing and we kinda went with it because the fans wanted it. They wore us down and we just said 'OK, fine! We're punk rock, similar to the Ramones. Whatever you say.'\"\n",
      "The Jakes formed in 2004 in Irvine, California. Consisting of Jacob Tilley, Addam Farmer, Kevin Massoudi, Ehson Hashemian, and Sameer Gadhia, the band's name was an acronym of the members' first names. After several personnel changes, the group's lineup by 2008 included Gadhia (born July 10, 1989), Tilley, Hashemian, Eric Cannata, Francois Comtois (born May 20, 1988), and Jason Burger. Initial coordination of musical contributions was difficult because the members all attended different schools. With two members still in high school and the others each attending different colleges, the Jakes recorded an EP, Shake My Hand, with producer Ian Kirkpatrick. Band members then individually decided whether or not to put their schooling on hold to focus on music. Burger left the band to pursue an education at Manhattan School of Music in New York City, and Comtois took over as the drummer. Shortly thereafter, longtime friend and collaborator Payam Doostzadeh (Persian: پیام دوستزده‎) joined as bassist. In 2009, the band played four shows at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas. The band's song \"Texas Tea\" was played during an episode of MTV's The Real World: Brooklyn, and \"Paid the Piper\" was featured on A&E's The Beast. Another song, \"Cough Syrup\", received airplay on the Los Angeles radio station KROQ. Shortly before signing to Roadrunner Records in August, keyboardist Ehson Hashemian left the band. In December 2009, the band announced they had changed their name to Young the Giant.\n",
      "On July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker left Panic! at the Disco, citing creative differences as the reason for their departure. Soon afterwards, it was announced that their new project would be a retro-leaning rock band called The Young Veins. Their song \"Change\" debuted on the duo's Myspace page, and their first album, Take a Vacation!, was announced. In late 2009 three additional members joined the band: Nick Murray on drums, Andy Soukal on bass and Nick White on keyboards. Three songs from Take a Vacation! were released as singles in April and May 2010, and the album itself was released in June 2010. \n",
      "Youth Brigade has released five studio albums (counting one released as The Brigade), of which the last was released in 1996. Almost each album was recorded with the original lineup of the Stern brothers (Mark, Adam and Shawn); bassist Bob Gnarly replaced Adam in 1985 during the recording of The Dividing Line, which was released as The Brigade. Adam returned in 1991 (when the band reunited) and contributed to the band's 1992 EP Come Again and their next two albums (Happy Hour and To Sell the Truth) before leaving once again in 2007. Youth Brigade continues to tour to this day, although, other than six new tracks on the 1999 split album BYO Split Series Volume II, they have not released a full-length studio album since To Sell the Truth in 1996.\n",
      "In 1977, The Zeros played their first major gig in Los Angeles at the Orpheum. Opening the show was the first performance by The Germs, followed by The Zeros and then The Weirdos. The gig was promoted by Peter Case of The Nerves, who later served as the frontman of The Breakaways and The Plimsouls. The Zeros' first single  release, \"Wimp\" b/w \"Don't Push Me Around\", was released in 1977 on Bomp! Records.\n",
      "Seeking to express themselves as youth caught between two cultures, they wrote songs about racism and issues within the Asian community, such as arranged marriage, leading to attacks both from neo-Nazis supporting the National Front as well as other Asians who felt they were disgracing their community. The band eventually recorded one single, \"Culture Crossover\" b/w \"Asian Youth\", which was released by Rock Against Racism Records.  They attracted the support of famed BBC DJ John Peel, who said he played them on air not just because they were Asian but because he liked their music.  However, they were otherwise ignored by mainstream media, and the group came to feel their music was not having the political effect they had hoped for. They declined an invitation to perform at a concert with The Specials at Coventry Stadium in protest of racial profiling by police because Ausaf and Azhar were due to sit their finals exams at the London School of Economics that same day, and disbanded soon after, having played only 30 shows.\n",
      "Emerging from associations with the hippy-orientated Here & Now, Nik Turner, Gong's Daevid Allen and Gilli Smyth, the Androids of Mu formed out of the Frestonia squatter community in Notting Hill Gate, West London, notable in its time for producing non-conformist music.\n",
      "The Apostles were formed in the Islington area of London in 1979 by William 'Bill' Corbett (vocals), Julian Portinari (bass), Dan McIntyre (drums) and Pete Byng-Hall (guitar). This line-up of the group did not play any concerts, and only appeared in a small number of fanzines (including Paroxysm Fear and New Crimes) before Bill Corbett left the group.\n",
      "Two of The Burial's earliest recordings, \"Backstreet Child\" and \"I Just Can't Forget\", appear on the compilation album Oi! The Demos (80-83), whose liner notes describe them as \"the prototype Skacore band\". They have three songs on the compilation Oi! of Sex — two as The Burial (\"Old Mans Poison\", \"Friday Night\") and one as Nick Toczek's Britanarchists (\"Stiff With a Quiff\"). Their song \"Sheila\" appears on the compilation The Sound of Oi!, and their song \"Holding On\" appears on  Oi! Glorious Oi!\n",
      "The band's debut single, \"She Grew Up\", originally released in 1984, reached no. 36 on the UK Independent Chart in 1986. The band signed to Jive Records, and their final single, \"Breathless\", reached number 99 in the UK Singles Chart. The band recorded two sessions for BBC Radio 1; A December 1983 session for David Jensen's show was broadcast in January 1984, and a May 1986 session was broadcast on Janice Long's show the following month. Their 1987 performance at the Golders Green Hippodrome was broadcast on BBC Radio 1's In Concert in June 1987.\n",
      "The first single from the Cravats was the self-financed \"Gordon\", released in 1978. On 31 July 1979 they recorded their first session for the John Peel show on BBC Radio 1. Soon after they received a recording contract with Small Wonder Records. Three further Peel Sessions followed on 6 October 1980, 18 August 1981 and 15 November 1982. Debut album In Toytown was released in 1980.\n",
      "The band formed in 1978 with a lineup of Ian \"Buck\" Murdock (vocals), Marcus \"Dukie\" Duke (guitar), Jeff Gilmore (bass) and Glenn Kingsmore (drums).\n",
      "Elton Motello is both the moniker of Alan Ward, the lead singer and songwriter, and the name of the band itself. Alan Ward was formerly a member of the glam punk band Bastard along with Damned guitarist Brian James, Dez Lover, future Raxola frontman Yves Kengen, and Nobby Goff.\n",
      "Between 1992 and 1995, Hooton Three Car recorded three sessions at Maida Vale Studios in London for broadcast on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show. These recordings were compiled on the band's 43-song discography released by Crackle! Records.\n",
      "The initial lineup in 1979 comprised the original members of Horley punk rock band Lockjaw (1976–1978); Gary Bowe (vocals), Simon Gallup (bass guitar), Stuart Hinton (guitar) and Martin Ordish (drums). They were joined by Matthieu Hartley (keyboards). The band's transition from Lockjaw to the Magspies coincided with their parting company with Raw Records, and expanding from their punk origins to explore post-punk and new wave. As they had done as Lockjaw, the Magspies continued to play regularly around Horley and Crawley with the Cure, among others. Both Lockjaw and The Magspies were managed and promoted by bassist Gallup's elder brothers Dave Gallup and Ric Gallup.\n",
      "The band consisted of four members:\n",
      "Initially playing exclusively on the London Irish bar circuit, apparently mainly for more hedonistic reasons, and with a correspondingly 'cavalier' attitude towards required band possessions and responsibilities, their name was serendipitously gleaned from the reaction to their approach by the exasperated (Irish) landlord at their first ever gig, cursing them with an old Irish saying using the term \"neck\" – implying high levels of nerve or impudence.\n",
      "New Hearts evolved out of college band Splitz Kidz, who met in Loughton and consisted of Ian Page (vocals), David Cairns (guitar), John Harty (bass) and drummer Rob Milne (who later drummed with The Clash on the Anarchy in The UK tour). Renaming themselves New Hearts, they were signed by CBS Records at the height of punk rock just two months after their debut gig, and with an average age of just 17, directly from CBS managing director Maurice Oberstein, who had taken a personal interest in the band and attended eight gigs in a row. They appeared on the opening day of the 1978 Reading Rock Festival alongside the likes of The Jam, Ultravox and Sham 69.\n",
      "Their subsequent LP, No Love Lost, (released by Corpus Christi Records, 1983) won the hearts of many hardened anarchos and secured their place in anarcho-punk history. A far more melodic style, encouraged by producer and new guitarist Pete Fender (from Rubella Ballet), created a highly influential template that many other bands were to build on. \n",
      "The band has split and re-formed several times, the first occasion in 1984 after which Moreno focused on his record labels, Oi! Records and Ska Records for the remainder of the decade.\n",
      "The band formed in early 1978, with an original line-up of Phil Stanton (vocals), Rob \"Spike\" Harrington (guitar and vocals), Andy Lealand (guitar), Mark \"Shark\" Harris (drums), and Mark \"Savage\" Parsons (bass guitar). Parsons and Stanton left in 1979, with Harrington moving to lead vocals, and Lealand's girlfriend Louise Wright joining on bass.\n",
      "Petrol Girls formed and played their first show in 2012, after just two practises, at a house party hosted by founding member Ren Aldridge (vocals) to celebrate International Women’s Day. Retaining original bassist Liepa Kuraitė, who had never played before Aldridge invited her to join, they eventually recruited Joe York (guitar) and Zock Astpai (drums) to complete a sustainable lineup.\n",
      "PFS disbanded in 1987 but reformed in 1999, after being featured on several punk compilation albums in the intervening years.\n",
      "The Piranhas formed in 1977, and were originally part of the Brighton punk scene, first coming  to prominence when DJ John Peel started playing their single \"I Don't Want My Body\" on his BBC Radio 1 programme, but achieved their biggest success with their cover version of the South African kwela song \"Tom Hark\". This had been an instrumental hit in 1958 for Elias & His Zig Zag Jive Flutes, and had already been covered in a ska style by Millie Small and by Georgie Fame on his 1964 EP \"Rhythm & Blue-Beat\".  With new lyrics written by the band's frontman \"Boring\" Bob Grover (allegedly en route to the recording studio), and with Pete Waterman on executive production duties, it was a Top 10 hit in the UK Singles Chart in 1980.\nIt was the first song to feature on BBC Television's pop music programme, Top of the Pops, when it returned in 1980 after being blacked out for nine weeks by industrial action. During the obviously mimed performance the drummer played using a pair of plastic fish as drumsticks.\n",
      "Emerging in 1978 out of the Nottingham punk/rhythm & blues band The Press, Medium Medium's first single was \"Them or Me\", which was released in late 1978 and was still selling well enough in 1980 to appear in the UK Independent Chart. The second single, \"Hungry, So Angry\", was released in February 1981 on Cherry Red Records. One of the first records to introduce slap bass - a technique borrowed from black funk music - to a generally white audience, \"Hungry, So Angry\" reached #48 in the Billboard Disco chart - the single and the album were released in 1981 on the New York-based indie label Cachalot Records - and has appeared on over a dozen compilations over the years.\n",
      "The punk band Raped formed in 1976 with a line-up of Sean Purcell (vocals), Faebhean Kwest (guitar), Tony Baggett (bass), and Paddy Phield (drums). They released the Pretty Paedophiles EP and the \"Cheap Night Out\" single in 1978 on Parole Records. Their last gig as 'Raped' was in Belfast with the punk band Rudi at Christmas 1978. In January 1979 they changed their name to 'Cuddly Toys'.\n",
      "Red Alert's original line-up — Steve 'Cast Iron' Smith (vocals), Tony Van Frater (guitar), Gaz Stuart (bass) and Dona (drums) — debuted in the summer of 1979, at a carnival in Sunderland, performing mostly Clash and UK Subs covers.\n",

Both acts had released records on the duo’s own record label Slampt, based in their adopted home town of Newcastle. Marc had previously drummed for Newcastle-based Post Hardcore/Rock bands Spinach and Kodiak.\n",
      "The band was formed in 1977 by Paul Burgess and Tom Coulter at the Boys Model School in Belfast, Coulter originally acting as vocalist but sticking to bass when Ivan Kelly joined. Kelly left in 1979 to join London band The Wall, and was replaced by Allan Clarke. By the time of their first release, \"One By One\" on Terri Hooley's Good Vibrations label, they had also been joined by guitarist Jackie Forgie. They had two hits on the UK Independent Chart, \"Capital Letters\", which reached number 31, and \"Wild Colonial Boy\" which reached number 46.\n",

      "Most of the band's songs were written by Alec Palao and Bal Croce\n",
      "Young and Barnes met at Cathays High School in Cardiff, and started writing and playing songs together.  They performed together from 1971 in the band John Stabber, and formed Do You Want This Table (later shortened to The Table) in 1972.  The band was named after an overheard random comment by a stranger, and originally intended being a studio-only recording group.\n",
      "The band formed in 1982 in Newtownards, Co, Down, after being inspired by the Crass gig at the Anarchy Centre in Belfast.  Featuring Phil on bass, Patsy on vocals, Colin McKee (Bangor) on drums to then be replaced by Grub and Marty on guitar they wanted to take the DIY and anti-establishment ethos of punk one step further. They played their first gig at the West Winds Roadhouse in 1982, and regularly played around Bangor, Belfast and the Ards area for the next two years, in the same scene as the Belfast band Stalag 17. In 1984 they moved to Belfast and were joined by second vocalist Roy Wallace. They gigged with Conflict in the Manhattan Club which resulted in them doing a number of recordings for Conflict's label Mortarhate. Members of the band were involved with the Belfast-based Warzone Collective, which included a vegetarian cafe called Giros, practice space for bands, and screen-printing studio.\n",
      "In 1977, Cambridge record dealer Lee Wood founded Raw Records, and quickly recorded The Users in March of the year, releasing the single \"Sick of You\" / \"(I'm) In Love With Today\" on May 5, 1977.  Sounds magazine stated that it \"burns into your brain without compromise.\"\n",

      "Early Toronto punk bands included the Viletones, the Diodes, the Poles, the Ugly, Cardboard Brains, the Dents, the Mods, the Secrets, ARSON and the Scenics, and these were followed by the Demics, Crash Kills Five, Stark Naked and the Fleshtones and L'Étranger, plus Hamilton's Forgotten Rebels and Teenage Head. In Vancouver D.O.A. and the Subhumans led a 1978-79-80 scene that included Pointed Sticks, Braineaters, Young Canadians, and the Modernettes.

      "The band received its earliest recognition in the mid-1990s by touring with My Dying Bride, Tiamat and Atrocity. Much like the latter two groups, the band had begun as traditional death metal, then evolved in an industrial music and gothic metal musical direction on later albums. The band received heavy rotation on MTV Germany, and made appearances at various extreme metal festivals, including Germany's Wacken Open Air in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2008, in addition to inclusion on Nuclear Blast compilation samplers.\n",
      "The band's original style, featured on their releases up to and including Allegro Barbaro and on a few songs on All You Need Is Love, consists of death/thrash metal blended with melodic compositions. In later albums, the death metal influence declined, resulting in less chaotic composition (often centered around a verse and chorus with a bridge and solo), more constant tempo, longer songs and clean vocals (although not exclusively). This resulted in a more polished and accessible sound. The band uses lyrics in both English and German with a shift from mainly English songs to more German ones on recent albums (Licht is entirely in German).\n",
      "Knorkator gained further fame (and some notoriety) in 2000 with their performance of Ick wer zun Schwein (sic; literally, in Berlin dialect, \"I'm turning into a pig\") in the German national qualification for the Eurovision Song Contest. After the qualification show, German tabloid BILD notoriously headlined \"Wer ließ diese Irren ins Fernsehen?\" (\"Who let these lunatics on TV?\").\n",
      "Samsas Traum started in 1996 when Kaschte released his first solo tape. Three years later the solo project became a group of three, and their official debut Die Liebe Gottes - Eine märchenhafte Black Metal Operette (The Love of God - A fairy tale-like black metal Operetta) divided the scene:\nSome people said that ST was the best newcomer of the year, other people rather started to hate them, at least also because of some provocative statements by Alexander Kaschte. The follow-up appeared in 2000 with Oh Luna mein (O, Luna mine); a musically matured and varied album of more polished arrangements, balanced instrumentation and beautiful choir-parts. In this time Alexander went on to create his darker alter-ego Weena Morloch, which was more noise music based, and included samples from horror movies. Many more Samsas Traum albums have been released each year, with more Industrial/Classical arrangements. The two new albums which have been released in November 2007 were also heading new and old ways: While the first album Heiliges Herz - Das Schwert Deiner Sonne was most likely a Black Metal-Epos, Wenn schwarzer Regen was an acoustic and very personal one.\n",
      "Stahlhammer is one of the most popular bands to ever come out of Austria. The band name was originally going to be \"Eisenherz\", but copyright laws for the German \"Prince Valiant\" stories prohibited this, though this later became the name of their fourth album. Their first album Killer Instinkt, released in 1995, became widely known throughout Austria and Germany due to the success of their video for the Pink Floyd cover \"Another Brick In The Wall\". Among Stahlhammer's several covers is a metal styled version of M.C. Hammer's famous hit U Can't Touch This.\n",

Of the band name, Beck has said: \"We had a list of names, and we were just like, let's pick one of these band names which ones the coolest. At the time there were a bunch of bands coming out with two names in one like that, like mouthpiece, curbjaw, stuff like that. We were going down the list, and the first name that I liked was Swiftkick. I'm all like, that’s a sick name. But for some reason Glassjaw stuck. There's really no reason behind it; it just sounded cool.\" The band played their first show in 1994 in Oceanside, NY. In the early days, Beck and Weinstock were also playing with Jewish straight edge metalcore band, Sons of Abraham. Sons of Abraham constitute an important influence on Glassjaw, songs such as \"Hurting and Shoving (She Should Have Let Me Sleep)\" by Glassjaw drawing particularly on earlier Sons of Abraham releases. Palumbo was in his own straight-edge band called XbustedX. The group's line-up changed constantly in their early years while they played in the local New York hardcore scene.

Coincidentally, that same week that Richard Hell (vocals/bass) left Television. After returning to New York, Thunders and Nolan invited Hell to join their new band, and Hell agreed. As Hell said, \"I was fed up with Television because it was getting so pretentious...so I thought, this is perfect - we'll make a really good rock & roll band that's dealing with interesting subjects.\" The three dubbed their new band the Heartbreakers. Their first gig was on May 30 of that year, at the Coventry, a rock club in Queens. (Tom Petty's backing band was also named the Heartbreakers, but they did not begin gigging until 1976.)

Stza to release songs that, for one reason or another, were never recorded by Choking Victim and which he claims are the \"Leftover songs\" - hence the name.  For almost two years following the band's formation, the band consisted almost solely of Stza, who recorded many of the songs that would feature on later releases onto a four-track recorder whilst searching for band members. The band eventually solidified (albeit temporarily) around a line-up of Scott \"Stza\" Sturgeon (vocals, additional guitars), Brad Logan of F-Minus (guitar), Alec Baillie (bass, previously of Choking Victim), Mike Trujillo of Blindsided (guitar) and Amery \"AWOL\" Smith (drums, previously of Suicidal Tendencies and the Beastie Boys).\n",

      "The members of Mod Fun started playing music together as childhood friends in early 1979, and initially called their band Rage.

In the Chicago Tribune, Jessica Hopper said: \"The Red Sea', is a visceral work...their moody songs are redolent of a time in the early '80s when punk fractured into something more tuneful and complex...a political band whose music is as strong as its message is a rare treat.' Venus Zine said: \"On paper, this band sounds like a train wreck, but in real life they are completely arresting....Old-world romance elegantly intertwined with riot grrrl piss and vinegar onstage...A lot of valid arguments have been made against overtly mixing politics and music — it takes the focus off important things like rhythm or, worse, excuses a band’s lack of talent or imagination. But those arguments don’t apply to bands whose politics become inseparable from the emotive quality of their sound.\" They toured again in Fall 2008 in support of The Red Sea.\n",

The band's lyrics flouted commonly held taboos and dealt frankly—and often explicitly—with politically and culturally loaded topics including murder, rape, child sexual abuse, arson, racism, and misogyny. Though the band's lyrics contained controversial material, the lyrics were meant to serve as a commentary or a display of distaste for the subject matter. They were staunchly critical of the commercial nature of rock, shunning the mainstream music industry and insisting on complete control over all aspects of their career. At the height of their success, they booked their own tours, paid for their own recordings, refused to sign contracts, and eschewed many of the traditional corporate trappings of rock bands. In doing so, they had a significant impact on the aesthetic and political development of independent and underground rock music.\n",

Although they never truly broke into the mainstream, their most successful song was 'XOYO' which came 41st in John Peel's Festive Fifty for 1982, which was the top 50 songs of the year as voted by the listeners. The song was an experiment to see whether John Cage's method of aleatoric composition could be successfully applied to popular music composition. XOYO also appeared on the Cherry Red compilation album Pillows & Prayers. The band broke up in 1983.\n",

In 2007 when the video of their newest single \"La revolución sexual\" was released, it was announced that the five members (sometimes called androids) were going to be relegated to some dancing sequences while Milkyway took lead of the band.\n",
      "The three original members of Chambao were María del Mar Rodriguez Carnero (La Mari), Eduardo Casañ (El Edi) and Daniel Casañ (Dani). They made waves in the world music scene with their new brand of flamenco, called flamenco chill, which combined the passion and vocal style of traditional Andalusian flamenco with elements of electronica, specifically chillout. Formed in the early morning hours of the 2001 summer solstice in Malaga, Spain, Chambao first appeared to the greater public on the 2002 Sony compilation Flamenco Chill, to which they contributed eight songs, featuring Mari on vocals and the others on the instrumentation. Two years later their first solo full-length, Endorfinas en la Mente, produced by Italian electronica expert Bob Benozzo, was released, followed the next year by Pokito a Poko, a record on which Dani contributed very little, as he left the group before it was finished. After touring for Pokito a Poko, Edi also decided to depart from the band, leaving Mari alone as the last remaining member. After successfully battling breast cancer, the singer returned to the stage and studio with Chambao, this time with a new seven-piece backing band. In 2007 the band released their fourth studio album Con Otro Aire. Frontwoman La Mari took the helm of composing, arranging and production duties and her African and Mexican influences are clearly audible throughout the record. Chambao returned five years later with their self-titled fifth release. They enlisted Carlos Raya (Fito & Fitipaldis, M-Clan) on production duties whose sleek skills complement the band’s ambient mixture of flamenco and electronic music. ~ Marisa Brown\nDiscovered by the Dutch musician Henrik Takkenberg. In 2005 El Edi and Dani departed the band. In 2003, they were winners of the Premios Ondas musical award for their debut album, Endorfinas en la mente (Endorphins in the Mind).\n",

      "Triana was formed in 1974 as a trio consisting of vocalist and organist Jesús de la Rosa Luque, guitarist Eduardo Rodríguez Rodway, and drummer Juan José Palacios, better known as Tele. The band released its untitled debut album (nick-named El patio) the next year, presenting a sound that blended elements of Andalusian flamenco music with progressive and psychedelic rock. Although a commercial failure, the album earned the band a cult following among the Spanish youth who, following the belated fall of fascism in the country, were interested in the subversive themes of rock (especially psychedelic rock) presented in Triana's music. In 1977, Triana released their second album, Hijos del agobio. This album was a bigger commercial success than their debut  and was notable for its politically-involved lyrics which reflected the tense and unstable nature of Spain's political climate at the time. Their third album, Sombra y luz, was released in 1979. Their most experimental album to date, Sombra y luz contained elements of jazz and was certified platinum by the AFYVE.\n",

The pair translated the lyrics into Spanish and produced the album themselves, with García singing as well as playing bass guitar, rhythm guitar, and keyboards. Guitarists Fernando Mon, formerly of Avalanch, and Pablo García of Relative Silence also collaborated on the album by recording guitar solos. Upon learning of García and Ardines' project, the other members of Avalanch disapproved of it and expelled them from the band. García has stated that he presented many of his song ideas to Avalanch, but received writing credit on only two released songs: \"Aquí Estaré\" and \"Por Mi Libertad\". \"Aquí Estaré\" had barely been accepted by the band but went on to become one of Avalanch's most popular songs, and so he decided \"to release a couple of songs, but never with the idea of leaving Avalanch.\"\n",

This sextet (Call, Louis, McFee, Hopper, Ciambotti and Shine) signed to the UK's Vertigo label, and worked with producer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange on Clover's 1976 non-LP single \"Chicken Funk\", and the group's early 1977 album entitled Unavailable.  Later that year, McFee, Ciambotti, Hopper and Shine (but not Louis or Call) backed Elvis Costello on his debut album My Aim Is True.  These musicians were not credited on the release for contractual reasons; some contemporary publicity for the album identified Costello's backing band as \"The Shamrocks\".\n",
      "Their signature song, \"Consolidated\", contained the mission statement \"Consolidated is not even a consumer product... yet.  This is no rock and roll band.  It is a unique creative vision of a small isolated group of individuals. A team that's skilled and dedicated.  Searching for the knowledge that will enable them to improve the quality of their lives and the lives of those around them.\"\n",
      "In Issue #13 of Ugly Things Magazine, critic Mike Stax wrote: \"CRIME's music didn't conform to the norm either.  They didn't use the standard-issue highspeed buzzsaw guitar approach.  Instead their noisy attacks were an unpredictable stew of clanging, howling guitars and shuddering rhythms - more of an intense sonic RUMBLE than anything else.\"\n",
      "Deafheaven formed in February 2010 in San Francisco, California with vocalist George Clarke and guitarist Kerry McCoy, who previously performed in the grindcore band Rise of Caligula together. Clarke is not sure how he arrived on the name Deafheaven, though he is aware of its appearance in William Shakespeare's Sonnet 29. The two words 'deaf' and 'heaven' were combined as a homage to Slowdive.\n",
      "Death Angel was formed in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, in 1982 by cousins Rob Cavestany (lead guitar, backing vocals), Dennis Pepa (lead vocals, bass), Gus Pepa (rhythm guitar), and Andy Galeon (drums) -- all of Filipino descent. After considering a number of different names for the band, including Dark Fury, Cavestany and D. Pepa settled on the name Death Angel after coming across a book by that title in a book store. In 1983, the band released their first demo, Heavy Metal Insanity, with Matt Wallace serving as producer. According to Mark Osegueda, the group was then \"more like a metal band, more like Iron Maiden, Tygers of Pan Tang and stuff like that\", as the so-called Bay Area thrash movement was only just beginning to rise to prominence at the time and make its influence felt.  Osegueda, a second cousin of the other four members who had been working as their roadie, became the group's lead vocalist in 1984 and performed his first show with the band on a bill with Megadeth in April of that year (at one of the four Megadeth gigs to feature Kerry King on guitars).\n",
      "The seed for Diego's Umbrella was planted by Tyson Maulhardt and Vaughn Lindstrom in 2001, who released a few albums on their own. The band slowly grew with the additions of violinist Jason Kleinberg, bassist Kevin Blair, singer Benjamin Leon, and drummer Jake Wood. With this configuration they created the signature \"gypsy pirate polka\" sound they are now known for. Benjamin Leon, in an interview explained their beginnings: \"I've been playing music since I was about 6 years old, from piano to drums, and then later I picked up guitar and started singing. I’ve known Tyson and Vaughn for about ten years, but I was playing in my own group in Los Angeles for most of that time. They knew I was burning out in LA so they kidnapped me at a Pinkberry in 2008 and we’ve been riding around in a van together ever since.\" Their quirky namesake comes from a friend's arm tattoo.\n",
      "Long self-released a solo EP titled Dodo Bird in March 2006, in which Long played all the instruments.  While they performed the songs from this release, Long and Kroeber met and started playing together.  They worked to blend Kroeber's training in West African Ewe drumming and Long's experience in metal bands to create music in which \"drumming could be a center role and help bring out the syncopated rhythms coming out of the acoustic guitar.\"\n",
      "Drummer John Hartman arrived in California  determined to meet Skip Spence of Moby Grape and join an aborted Grape reunion. Spence introduced Hartman to singer, guitarist, and songwriter Tom Johnston and the two proceeded to form the nucleus of what would become the Doobie Brothers. Johnston and Hartman called their fledgling group \"Pud\" and experimented with lineups (occasionally including Spence) and styles as they performed in and around San Jose. They were mostly a power trio (along with bassist Greg Murphy) but briefly worked with a horn section.\n",
      "Towards the end of their high school days, while they were still known as The Electrocutes, they decided to create another band (with the same members) that would play softer tunes without distorting the metal queen image of The Electrocutes. To help their fans distinguish between the two bands, they all took matching \"Donna\" monikers, where all of their names were Donna and their last names were the first initial of their last name (Brett Anderson became Donna A, etc.), which they used only when performing as \"The Donnas.\"\n",
      "The band recorded its second full-length album in March 2006 with engineer Aaron Prellwitz (Neil Young, Sun Kil Moon) and producer Christian Hanlon (Unbunny, the Ebb and Flow)\n",
      "In 1984, they independently released their first full-length album I Do It For You, with the track \"Running Wild, Running Free\" receiving a music video which was aired on the MTV Basement Tapes in 1983. They were signed by Atco/Atlantic Records and released two albums Go Out and Get It and Looking for Adventure in 1985 and 1987, respectively. Failing to reach the popularity expected, they were subsequently dropped from their label. They returned to the studio and released Dig Down Deep  independently in 1988 followed by Stand Tall in 1989. They also flirted with a name change to \"The Tide\" around this time. Eventually, they withdrew from the music scene and moved on with their personal lives.\n",
      "The genesis of Faith No More was the group Sharp Young Men, formed in 1979 by vocalist Mike Morris and keyboardist Wade Worthington. Drummer Mike Bordin and bassist Billy Gould joined afterwards. Mike Morris described the name as \"a piss-take on all the ‘elegant’ groups at the time\". Later on, Morris proposed the name Faith In No Man, but, eventually, the band settled on Bordin's suggestion Faith No Man (stylized as Faith. No Man).\nThe band recorded \"Quiet in Heaven/Song of Liberty\", released in 1983. The songs were recorded in Matt Wallace's parents' garage, where Wallace had set up and been running a recording studio while the band was still recording under the name Sharp Young Men, with Mike Morris, Billy Gould, Mike Bordin and Wade Worthington. Worthington left shortly thereafter. They changed their name to Faith No Man for the release of the single, which featured two of the three songs recorded in Wallace's garage, and hired Roddy Bottum to replace Worthington. Bottum, Gould and Bordin quit the band shortly after and formed Faith No More. They chose the name to accentuate the fact that \"The Man\" (Mike Morris) was \"No More\". The band played with several vocalists and guitarists, including a brief stint with Courtney Love, until they settled on vocalist Chuck Mosley in 1983 and later, guitarist Jim Martin.\n",
      "After 'Falling off the Wagon' was featured on KFOG’s Local Scene 7 CD in 2010, the band gained attention from Bay Area radio stations, receiving airplay on Bay Area public radio station KALW-FM, San Francisco's Pirate Cat Radio, KSFS and KVON. In-studio performances include live sets on KALX Berkeley, Seattle's KEXP. in January 2012, and a live set at San Francisco's KFOG Playspace in May 2012.\n",
      "Cork Marcheschi (born 1945) grew up in Burlingame, California. In his teens, he performed with the Ethix, who played R&B music in clubs around San Francisco and in Las Vegas, and released one experimental and wildly atonal single, \"Bad Trip\", in 1967, with the intention that the record could be played at any speed. Interested in the ideas of experimental composers like Edgard Varèse, John Cage, Terry Riley, and George Antheil, he constructed his own custom-made electronic instrument from a combination of elements like theremins, fuzzboxes, a cardboard tube, and a speaker from a World War II bomber.\n",
      "In 2003, the band released Alwaysnever, an EP on Amazing Grease Records, a record label founded by Scott Kannberg from the band Pavement. Donny Newenhouse later replaced Montesano on drums.

      "The band broke up in 1999, though not before signing up a new label for distributing their music in Europe. In late 2001, Karloff started working on a new musical project. Led by his passion for the old style rock music, he formed the Bonedrivers, a blues rock power trio which has since then toured the United States and published a locally acclaimed debut album named Roadhouse Manifesto, an even bigger second outing titled Mobile, and a third one titled Greasefire.\n",
      "Graham Central Station's biggest hit was \"Your Love\", which charted at number 38 in 1975. The group also integrated gospel music into their repertoire, and played with the dichotomy between the funk/rock star image and the \"sanctified\" gospel group image. Some of their recordings feature the Tower of Power horn section.\n",
      "The band released only one single during its lifetime, the Darby Slick-penned \"Someone to Love\" (b/w \"Free Advice\"). The single was issued in February 1966 on Autumn Records' a tiny Northbeach subsidiary label and made little impact outside of the Bay Area. While signed to Autumn Records, the band worked with the label's staff producer Sylvester Stewart (better known as Sly Stone), who at the time was still in the process of forming Sly and the Family Stone. Purportedly, Stewart eventually walked out as the band's producer after it took The Great Society over 50 takes to record a version of the song \"Free Advice\" that was suitable for release.\n",
      "Hickey recorded their first 7\" EP, Us vs. Them, within a month of forming and released it soon afterwards.

      "Modeled after the names of bands in the 1950s, Joe Crane and his Hoodoo Rhythm Devils signed with Capitol Records under the direction of Michael Sunday and Jack Leahy, made their first record Rack Jobber's Rule in 1971. The name was too big of a mouthful, so it was shortened to the Hoodoo Rhythm Devils. Roger Allen Clark, fresh from the Steve Miller Band, was added on drums with the second album, The Barbecue of DeVille on Blue Thumb Records in 1972. The Hoodoos toured extensively that year playing with Savoy Brown, The Doobie Brothers, Steely Dan, Chuck Berry, John Lee Hooker, Graham Central Station, Tower of Power, Mott the Hoople, Bloodrock, and The Tubes. Roger Clark left to become a studio session drummer working for Rick Hall in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Keith Knudsen, formerly of Lee Michaels' band and later the Doobie Brothers, then joined for a short stint on drums from late 1972 to mid 1973 before Jerome Kimsey joined the band for the recording of their third album, What the Kids Want, for Blue Thumb Records in 1973. The Hoodoos continued to tour the United States and Joe began having some of his songs covered by Johnny Winter, The Chambers Brothers, Rodger Collins, and Patti LaBelle.\n",

      "In September 1969, Kaukonen and Casady employed the moniker for a week of acoustic-based concerts at the New Orleans House in Berkeley, California; recordings culled from this engagement were released as the band's eponymous debut album in 1970. This album has become affectionately known by the group's fans as the \"breaking glass album\", because of the sound of breaking beer glasses during the recording of \"Uncle Sam Blues.\" Some tracks included Will Scarlett on harmonica.  After the album was recorded, Jorma's brother Peter Kaukonen soon replaced Kantner on rhythm guitar and Jefferson Airplane co-lead vocalist Marty Balin joined on vocals for the electric songs. In 1970, the younger Kaukonen was replaced by Paul Ziegler.\n",
      "After Cringer disbanded, the pair's new three-piece group, J Church, began. The band was named for the San Francisco Muni Metro J Church line that Hahn took down Church Street to band practice and to work every day. They went through a large number of drummers in their career; a noteworthy early player was the former Jawbreaker drummer Adam Pfahler. From its inception, J Church embarked upon writing and recording what became an extensive discography including numerous singles and splits with fellow punk rock bands including Discount and Less Than Jake. The group has released an estimated 150 records.\n",

The band's debut LP, It's Yours to Keep, was released in April 2005 by Jackpine Social Club, and featured ten tracks.  The album was met with generally positive reviews, though some reviewers thought the album fell short of the band's talent.  It reached #85 on  College Music Journal's CMJ Radio 200 chart.  The band recently signed with Talking House Records, and their second full-length album, Secrets of the Sea, was released in October 2008.

According to Yu, the six-track EP Bed of Gold was recorded before LoveLikeFire had \"fully developed its identity as a band.\" Nevertheless, the album received critical praise from The A.V. Club San Francisco, LA Weekly, and the East Bay Express. The group continued touring, performing alongside bands such as Morningwood, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, and Favourite Sons.\n",
      "At this time,  Gannon  took over as manager. We seemed to be moving along okay during the recording. The noise appeared to be giving it a supportive reaction. When it hit the shelves, our strongest fanbase in Germany either shunned the record or didn't know about our forthcoming tour. There were no pre-sale tickets for the tour. Noise pulled the plug on the tour. We said, 'Fuck you,' by disbanding. We were not bluffing. The tour cancellation and growing tension between Gannon and Karl from Noise led to the ultimate sacrifice: ending the band.",

Although they lacked the managerial acumen and cultural cachet of the Grateful Dead and elected to remain in East Palo Alto, California unlike the former group, which soon relocated to the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, the New Delhi River Band were considered by late 1966 to be the house band of The Barn (one of the region's few viable concert venues outside of San Francisco) in Scotts Valley, California. The group continued to enjoy a cult following in Santa Clara and Santa Cruz Counties through the Summer of Love until their dissolution in early 1968.\n",
      "The Nuns original manager was Edwin Heaven. In 1977, Heaven discovered them when they opened at The Mabuhay Gardens for The Ramones.

      "The Other Half formed in Los Angeles Southern California, but later moved to San Francisco. They played several shows at Chet Helms Family Dog shows at the Avalon Ballroom. Their music was strongly influenced by Yardbirds and Rolling Stones. Guitarist Randy Holden had been offered the chance to replace Jeff Beck in the Yardbirds before joining The Other Half. The Other Half were at their peak when the music scene was at its height in San Francisco and the Flower Power movement in full swing in Haight Ashbury.  Their style changed from an earlier vocal based garage band, to the loudest big stage band sound of the time, taken in that direction by former Sons of Adam guitarist Randy Holden. Their sound has been compared to The Yardbirds, and contained elements of blues, hard rock, and Eastern melodic influences. Holden left the band after their debut album was recorded, dissatisfied with the recording and the guitar he was playing at the time, later stating \"I was trying to accommodate everyone else, at the expense of my own soul and happiness\". Despite Holden's misgivings, the album has been described as \"awesome incendiary rock\".\n",

In 1994, the group released its second album, Genocide & Juice. The group took a four-year recording hiatus to work as community activists before releasing Steal This Album to critical acclaim in 1998. The record's title pays tribute to 1960s radical Abbie Hoffman's yippie manifesto, Steal this Book. Steal This Album featured the stand-out single, \"Me and Jesus the Pimp in a ’79 Granada Last Night.\" The online magazine Dusted called Steal This Album \"the best hip-hop album of the 1990s\".\n",
      "After Rypins joined, they played shows sporadically during its early years, with vocalist Ott living on the streets of Berkeley for a time. In February 1987, the group recorded their first demo tape, which received enough circulation that Maximumrocknroll asked the band to record songs for the magazine's upcoming compilation Turn It Around!, to which the band agreed and recorded \"Another Day\" and \"Rearranged\" in August. Shortly after, they went to Dangerous Rhythm in Oakland, California to record songs for their debut EP with producer/engineer Kevin Army. David Hayes, co-founder of Lookout Records, was impressed with the band and offered to release the tracks recorded at Dangerous Rhythm. The group agreed and their debut EP Sleep, What's That? was released in January 1988. Idon Bryant, a friend of the band's, joined on second guitar soon after and they went to Dancing Dog Studios in Emeryville, California to record their debut album in April.

After considering a number of different names for the band, including Dark Fury, Cavestany and D. Pepa settled on the name Death Angel after coming across a book by that title in a book store. In 1983, the band released their first demo, Heavy Metal Insanity, with Matt Wallace serving as producer. According to Mark Osegueda, the group was then \"more like a metal band, more like Iron Maiden, Tygers of Pan Tang and stuff like that\", as the so-called Bay Area thrash movement was only just beginning to rise to prominence at the time and make its influence felt.  Osegueda, a second cousin of the other four members who had been working as their roadie, became the group's lead vocalist in 1984 and performed his first show with the band on a bill with Megadeth in April of that year (at one of the four Megadeth gigs to feature Kerry King on guitars).\n",
      "Now with a stable and complete lineup, Defiance began playing shows in the Bay Area. With the local thrash scene gaining momentum, the band attained local notoriety. Their first demo was released in 1987. Shortly afterwards Mayes left the band and was replaced by Ken Elkington. With Elkington the band issued their Hypothermia demo in 1988. This demo caught the attention of the independent metal label Roadracer Records, who signed the band that year. At Roadracer's insistence, the band traveled to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to record their debut album with Annihilator guitarist Jeff Waters.\n",
      "Toby left the band in 1991, and Joey of Blatz stepped in shortly before the band's premature 1992 break-up.

In 1999 they released Lucky on Subcity Records and participated in that label's first Take Action Tour. Most of the Lucky album, are song first done by a band that attempted to not have a name, but was named by others, Jeff, Tim, and Adam.

Flynn named the band after a song by the Chicago band War Cry that was featured on the Metal Massacre 4 compilation.  They recorded demo tapes and appeared on the now-out-of-print live album The Eastern Front – Live At Ruthie's Inn. By 1986, Jim Pittman, John Tegio, and Robb Flynn left the band and were replaced by Paul Bostaph (drums), Matt Camacho (bass) and Glen Alvelais (guitar). The band's name was shortened to Forbidden in order to prevent the band from being mistakenly perceived as a black metal band.\n",

      "Despite its ubiquity in San Francisco's early punk scene, the band's recording history was brief. A 7\" EP was recorded in 1979 for Subterranean Records, “Start Rite Now”, a cover of The Sonics' “Psycho”, and “Electric 3rd Rail.\"  In 1980, a second 7\" 45, “Time of the Assassins/Jar Wars,” was recorded and released on a label run by Universal Records, a Telegraph Avenue record store. It featured a pic sleeve designed by Grammy-winning artist Hugh Brown showing Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey Oswald outside Berkeley's Elmwood Theater. Both songs received airplay on local college stations like KALX and performed strongly on the Mabuhay Gardens Rotten Record Chart. Mike Montalto (ex Special Guests, later with Red Meat) then joined on guitar. Sessions at Fantasy Studios for an EP \"Teenage Rebellion\" took place in 1981, but were never released.\n",
      "Jellyfish broke up in 1994 due to poor record sales, Sturmer's discomfort with his role as frontman, and artistic conflicts between the two songwriters. Manning subsequently formed Imperial Drag, with Dover, and pursued careers as a solo artist and session musician. Sturmer worked with the Japanese pop duo Puffy AmiYumi and has kept a low public profile. In 2017, Manning, Dover, and Smith reformed as the Lickerish Quartet.\n",
      "Shortly after the release of that disc the brothers recruited their friend Jon Bush to play drums and began playing fully amplified shows in Santa Cruz and Oakland with bands like The Botticellis, Minkus, Desa and The Matches. Many of these early shows, while well received, were plagued with sound problems, mostly because of the feedback that comes from amplifying and distorting acoustic instruments. Eventually the band refined their techniques, bought the right kind of gear and figured out how to make their sound work on stage.\n",
      "Lȧȧz Rockit released the next two albums, Know Your Enemy in 1987 and Annihilation Principle in 1989, under their new label Roadrunner Records/Enigma Records, with both albums being well received by fans and critics, and seeing them share the stage with the likes of Metallica, Megadeth, Exodus, Anthrax, Overkill, Testament, M.O.D., Celtic Frost, Kreator, Voivod, Nuclear Assault, Vio-lence, Forbidden, Metal Church, D.B.C., Suicidal Tendencies, the Cro-Mags, Faith No More and L.A.

The two soon recruited guitarist Scott Sargeant, bassist Scott Dominguez and drummer Dave Chavarri. In 1991, the album Nothing's Sacred was released. After touring in the United States and Europe from 1991 to 1992, and making an appearance in Japan in 1992, the band split-up. Most of the members then formed the short-lived groove-oriented thrash metal band Gack, Replacing Chavarri with Defiance drummer Matt Vander Ende.\n",

The Loading Zone was based at the Berkeley venue The New Orleans House, but performed numerous times at major venues including the Fillmore West.\n",
      "Looking to start a punk band, Livermore had trouble finding members, citing the majority of the local musicians being hippies and \"completely uninterested in the music we wanted to make.\"  Eventually, Livermore recruited  14-year-old Kain Hanschke on bass and 12-year-old  Frank Edwin \"Tré\" Wright III on drums.  Although he had never before played drums, young Tré showed an instant affinity for them, likely because, as Livermore said, \"he loved making a lot of noise and getting everyone to look at him.\"\n",

For Misery Loves Company and the subsequent touring the band featured Brandon Arnovick on keyboards and Kenneth Hard on drums. At some point Arnovick and Hard departed, and Hard was replaced by Michael Urbano on drums.

      "Bishop O'Dowd High School sophomores Matt Esposito (lead guitar, backing vocals) and Justin San Souci (bass guitar, backing vocals) and freshman Matt Whalen (drums, percussion) started the band in 1997. Sophomore Shawn Harris (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) saw them play at the school talent show and soon joined them: \"I offered to play second guitar and add some original songs to the mix, and we spent the next four years getting noise complaints from neighbors.\" The four named their band the Locals. In 2000 they came to the attention of Miles Hurwitz, former assistant publisher of BAM, through his eighth-grade son. He attended one of their practices, later saying that \"I saw a spark — talent, vocal charm, hook-tinged material, musical accomplishment and much potential. And much to be improved.\" Hurwitz, 28 years the bands members' senior, became their manager. He would play a critical role in their career, co-writing some songs with Harris, producing their albums, directing some of their music videos, and participating in creative decisions including planning the group's image, wardrobe, and photographs. In their later album credits, the band nicknamed him \"The Wizard.\" \"Miles kept us together,\" said Harris in 2008; \"We didn't know we could be in a band. We didn't know how to make that jump  We'll work with him forever. He's an integral part of our equation.\"\n",
      "The original Montrose lineup, consisting of Ronnie Montrose on guitar, Sammy Hagar (then known as Sam Hagar) on lead vocals, Bill Church on bass, and Denny Carmassi on drums, was formed in early 1973 after Ronnie Montrose decided to leave the Edgar Winter Group. Both Hagar and Carmassi had previously worked together and were recruited from local San Francisco-area cover bands, while Bill Church and Ronnie Montrose were acquainted from their session work with singer Van Morrison and producer Ted Templeman. This prior connection provided the band with access to Templeman who heard their demos and helped the newly formed group secure a deal with Warner Bros. The band, as yet officially unnamed and billed as ‘Ronnie Montrose and Friends’, made their public debut on April 21, 1973 via a forty-five-minute radio broadcast aired on KSAN FM's Tom Donahue show. The broadcast featured the band's complete ten song performance recorded at the Record Plant in Sausalito, consisting of their entire first album (excluding \"Space Station No. 5\") as well as the unreleased tracks \"Roll Me Nice\", \"You’re Out of Time\", and \"Roll Over Beethoven\".

      "These bands played throughout 1990, but in early 1991, Tim, Greg, Isaac and Mike got back together and got serious about being a rock band. It didn't take long to step up from parties in Chico, CA to local bars and dance clubs like LaSalles and Juanita's. They began playing original songs rather than covers. The band released Back to the Grotto in February 1993.

It was not until April of the following year that the band played their first live show at Punks With Presses in Oakland along with Rancid and The Gr'Ups. The band then released their second EP, Fahizah. In 1993, Kirsch left the band citing personal differences with Armstrong's decision to sign to a major label with Green Day.

The album received mostly positive reviews upon its release in the summer of 1988, and peaked at number 154 on the Billboard 200, becoming the band's only album to enter that chart; this can be attributed to the album selling over 30,000 copies. Vio-lence toured throughout 1988 and 1989 in support of Eternal Nightmare, with bands such as Testament, Voivod, Death Angel, Sanctuary, Nuclear Assault, D.R.I., M.O.D. and the Cro-Mags.

As Meniketti has said in numerous radio, television, and magazine interviews over the past four decades, a new record deal in 1980 with A&M Records prompted the band to shorten their moniker to simply Y&T, as influenced by their encores where fans would chant \"Y&T, Y&T, Y&T.\"\n",

      "\"Psychotic Reaction\", an acknowledged cornerstone of garage rock, was initially devised by Byrne, with the group refining it and turning it into the highlight of their live sets. The song was influenced by the style of contemporary musicians such as The Standells and The Yardbirds. The band was rejected by several record labels before they got signed to the Los Angeles-based Double Shot Records. \"Psychotic Reaction\" was released as a single, peaking at number five in the U.S. charts in late 1966. The band enjoyed limited success for a short time, dropping out of view altogether when their only hit had fallen from public memory. Another setback to a potential career in the music business was the decision of four of the five members (who at that time were between the ages of 17 and 22) to pursue college degrees. Several months before the retirement of the band, David Eugene McDowell, the youngest player at 17 hooked up with the group as a guitar player for their last several months as a band. \"Dave\" shortly later went on to join up with Billy Nix and the Ideals as their Bass player.  \n",

They were mostly a power trio (along with bassist Greg Murphy) but briefly worked with a horn section.\n",
      "The band was formed after Lars' friend and bandmate in Rancid, Tim Armstrong suggested writing songs about Lars and his friend Ben growing up in Campbell, California. The band was then put together as an outlet to release these songs, as well as covers of Billy Bragg's \"To Have and to Have Not\", Holland-Dozier-Holland's \"Leaving Here\" (which was also covered by Motörhead). This first album was named Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards.\n",
      "Monkey was formed in the summer of 1995, by Curtis Meacham and Kevin Miller. In 1997 Monkey's first full-length release, ¡Changito!, was released.  The lineup of the band changed numerous times after this, with Meacham and Miller remaining. In 1999, they won a Bay Area Music award, or Bammy. Their second self-released album, Station Wagon Living came out during the \"crash\" of third wave ska. Co-founding member Miller left the band in 2001. Meacham, up until then lead singer and organ player, became the band's lead guitarist. Monkey were signed in 2004, and released their first label supported album, Cruel Tutelage on Asian Man Records.

In 1991, Dodge rejoined on second guitar and they released their second album, Don't Miss the Train, in 1992 before signing up with Fat Mike's label Fat Wreck Chords in 1993. In late 1992, Dodge left the line-up, and was replaced by the guitarist Robin Pfefer, who took over on lead guitar so that Sly could step down to rhythm and concentrate on singing. No Use for a Name also released their first record on Fat Wreck Chords that year, The Daily Grind (EP), which turned out to be highly successful.\n",

From there it attracted the attention of Bill Gavin's tip sheet and then executives at Bell Records in New York. Bell released it nationally and offered the group a contract for an album.  Replacing Larry Ray with lead guitarist Jim Sawyers, they wrote and recorded the LP in three weeks. They then began a national tour appearing with other hit acts such as: Paul Revere & the Raiders, the Young Rascals, and the Yardbirds. \"Little Girl\" peaked at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 on 9–16 July 1966 and #5 on Cashbox.

In this line-up they recorded their early demo tapes Cadaveric Incubator of Endo-Parasites (in 1993), Symphonies for Pathologist (in 1994) and Analyse of Pathological Conceptions (in 1995).

      "The band broke up in the late 1980s and Wino went west to California to join up with Saint Vitus. Wino recorded three albums, an EP, and a live album with Saint Vitus. Hellhound Records (Vitus's then current label) released The Obsessed, an album that the Obsessed had recorded in 1985, which prompted Wino to leave Vitus and reform the Obsessed with a new rhythm section consisting of Scott Reeder and Greg Rogers. The band was quickly signed to Hellhound Records and soon released Lunar Womb. Scott Reeder later left to join Kyuss, whereupon he was replaced by Guy Pinhas. After the addition of Pinhas, the Obsessed signed with Columbia Records, through which they released their third album The Church Within to strong critical reviews. To promote The Church Within, the band toured as an opening act for Entombed and Unsane during the first part of 1994. Despite the tour, as well as a large amount of promotion on behalf of Columbia Records (including a 25-minute documentary on the history of the Obsessed), the album did not sell as well as expected. After the demise of the Obsessed, Wino went on to form Shine which changed name to Spirit Caravan and more projects before reuniting with Saint Vitus in 2003 (and again in 2008), while the Obsessed's rhythm section became the basis for Goatsnake.\n",
      "In 1977, Rod Swenson, who received his Master of Fine Arts in 1969 from Yale where he specialized in conceptual, performance and neo-dadaist art, held the view that the measure of true or high art is how confrontational it is. He began a series of counter-culture projects which, by the mid-'70s, found him in the heart of Times Square producing experimental counter-culture theater as well as video and shows with the likes of the then-little-known bands The Dead Boys, The Ramones, Patti Smith, and others. It was there that he met Wendy O. Williams (her actual birth-given name, the O. standing for Orlean and her initials spelling \"WOW\") after Wendy found a copy of Show Business Weekly someone had discarded on the bus station floor.

      "The first grouping initially known as \"The Johnson Boys\", formed in 1975 as a duo featuring Dudley Connell on banjo and Ron Welch on guitar.  Eddie D'Zmura, a high school friend of Dudley Connell's, joined soon thereafter on mandolin. The band was renamed, \"The Johnson Mountain Boys\" after learning of another folk band already using the \"Johnson Boys\" name. The name The Johnson Mountain Boys was suggested by George Connell, Dudley's father. The \"Johnson Mountain\" referred to in the name of the band is a fictitious name (i.e. there is no Johnson Mountain in any of the areas from which any of the band members came).  The group became a full five-piece band in January 1978 featuring Connell on guitar, Franny Davidson on banjo—replaced by Richard Underwood after the band's first recording session—Eddie D'Zmura on mandolin, David McLaughlin on fiddle, and Gary Reid on bass.  Gary Reid left the group in late 1978 and started the Copper Creek record company.  He was replaced by Mark Prindle on the bass.  The Johnson Mountain Boys first commercial record release was Copper Creek Records number 0001 featuring original instrumental composition \"Johnson Mountain Hoedown\" written by Dudley Connell and Ed D'Zmura. The B side was \"When I Can Forget\" a song written by Dudley Connell.  The personnel on the record was Dudley Connell on guitar and vocals, David McLaughlin on fiddle and vocals, Ed D'Zmura on mandolin, Franny Davidson on banjo, and Mark Prindle on bass.  After the release of the first Copper Creek single, David McLaughlin went off to college and continued to play fiddle part-time with the band.  After David McLaughlin left for college, Eddie Stubbs performed his first show on fiddle with the Johnson Mountain Boys in November 1978 when he was just 16 years old, just a week before his 17th birthday.  From that point, he was considered the main fiddle player for the group, but played only once per week with the group since he was still in high school (senior year).  Since Eddie was not able to perform every show because of school, the fiddle duties were covered by David McLaughlin, Bill Belford, and Carl Nelson when Eddie was not able to appear.  In May 1979, Eddie became the full-time fiddle player for the group at age 17.  He graduated from Gaithersburg High School that June.  In 1979, before the recording of their second Copper Creek record, Mark Prindle was replaced by Larry Robbins on bass.  The group's second record was Copper Creek Records number 0101, an EP featuring \"Sitting Alone in the Moonlight,\" \"Eddie's Hoedown,\" \"Where We'll Never Die,\" and \"No Depression in Heaven.\"  In 1980, the band was picked up by Rounder Records.  The group's self-titled first album won considerable acclaim.  After the release of their first Rounder album, David McLaughlin left college in early 1981 to rejoin the group full-time, replacing Ed D'Zmura on mandolin.  Subsequent albums made the group young standard bearers of traditional bluegrass in the 1980s. In 1986, there were two personnel changes. Marshall Wilborn replaced Larry Robbins on bass in June and Tom Adams replaced Richard Underwood on banjo in September.\n",

In 1961, bassist Roger Bush replaced Eric Jr., who had left the band to get married.  That same year, the quartet had become popular enough to appear twice on The Andy Griffith Show.

Then, by total fluke, my mom’s friend’s husband, Ron Obvious, hired me to help with the audio wiring for a studio he was building for Bryan Adams.” Obvious introduced Katie to the world of independent music, and what she calls \"that ’80s sound.\" He created mix-tapes of bands he thought she’d appreciate as a violinist (Roxy Music, Ultravox) and singers with an \"amazing natural vocal pitch\" (Siouxsie and the Banshees, Nina Hagen, Kate Bush)). This job also led Sketch to Tara Nelson, the engineer who would later record the Organ’s first EP.\n",

However, shortly before disbanding, the band had recorded a new 7\" single, \"The Teacher Gets it\", which was released in early 1997.

Under the Gun reviews described their sound as \"Sending out posi vibes to kids fighting in the crowd during the band’s last set, Pete screams his sober heart out while Joe Trohman filled in on guitar and Patrick Stump took role of drummer\". In reference to their sole studio album, TeethOfTheDevine.com said that \"Where most bands in this space use death and thrash metal devices to create a sense of heaviness missing in traditional hardcore, Arma Angelus’ thick, angular attack comes from a rock and roll sense of composition that’s every bit as heavy as their metal-infused counterparts. True, elements of Where Sleeplessness is Rest from Nightmares do delve into death metal territory (vocals, tuning), the majority of Arma Angelus’ material pummels to the tune of catchy, head-bashing song structure.\" Upon their disbandment, the members stated that \"the goal of Arma Angelus was to express and stimulate discourse within the punk and hardcore community and to express our distaste for apathy and uncaring, which we felt had become ideals with in the community\"\n",

      "Attempts to characterize The Effigies as post-punk, hardcore and, to the extent it is distinguishable, Chicago hardcore, reveal the difficulty in pigeonholing the band's sound which is more expansive than the punk subgenres both musically and thematically. Even the catch-all \"post-hardcore\" becomes an inapt anachronism in light of the fact that the band's seminal releases pre-date the arrival of hardcore by several years. Indie rock pundit Steve Albini writes that \"The Effigies were absolutely essential to the development of a healthy punk scene in Chicago. Between them and Naked Raygun, in the early 80s they basically kept the scene going until it developed momentum beyond them.\"  \"The Effigies were a moving force during a crucial and exhilarating time.\"\n",
      "The band played around Chicago and the midwest in the summer of 1993. When the fall came, Mojica decided to drop out of school to devote more time to the band and the record label, while Shrader left the band and returned to SIU.

      "The band formed in the early 1990s by singer Martin Sorrondeguy and guitarist José Casas, who remained the group's consistent members through changing rhythm sections. Their lyrics were almost always sung in Spanish; the song \"We're That Spic Band\" (written in response to an audience member calling them a \"spic band\") is the sole exception. Los Crudos' lyrics were explicitly political, addressing issues such as class, police brutality, homophobia, and California ballot propositions directed against immigrants.  At concerts, Sorrondeguy would often speak at length about the songs' meanings between songs, partly as a way of getting around the language barrier (audiences were not always happy about this).  Their music was loud, fast, and energetic with songs built around three chords or fewer. \"We're That Spic Band\" and \"Asesinos\" (about \"the disappearances of radical youth during military dictatorships in Latin America\") have both been described as their most well-known songs.\n",

The album cover resembled a book of matches (the band's name derives from the phrase commonly seen on cheap matchbooks). Songs included \"Sunday Night Disorientation\", \"Context\", \"Closing In\", \"Elephant's Graveyard\" (which later appeared on the Wax Trax Best of boxed set), and the title track. Immediate Action received mixed reviews; however, as one of the first actual recordings by a local punk outfit in the Windy City, looms large in the memory of denizens of the early Chicago punk scene, and has been called an \"integral document to the history of punk rock in Chicago\".\n",

On stage, they mean business.\" They are \"Straight up rock 'n rollers, they blend classic rock tactics to make their sound aggressive with enough melodic hooks to lodge their choruses into the mind long after the show is over.

Smith had been a former sideman with Ray Charles and The Temptations and a member of Vector. The next album, The Seventy Sevens, was released by Island Records in 1987. While the album received favorable reviews, it did not sell as well as it might; the reason being The Joshua Tree by labelmate U2 was released that same year. In his article on the subject, John Thompson (True Tunes) thought it likely that Island put most of its resources into promoting The Joshua Tree while others on the label received less promotional support. The album received a positive review by Rolling Stone critic, Margot Mifflin: \"the 77s have come up with a sound that suggests not only that they know where they’re coming from, but also that they’re going places\". Mark Alan Powell called it \"an artistic masterpiece – probably one of the ten best albums of the year not simply in the Christian market but in rock and roll, period\".\n",

Becoming popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Creed released three consecutive multi-platinum albums, with their album Human Clay being certified diamond. Creed has sold over 28 million records in the United States, has sold over 53 million albums worldwide, and was the ninth best-selling artist of the 2000s.

      "The band first garnered attention in the underground music scene following the release of their first full-length record Four Wall Blackmail, which was released by Tooth & Nail subsidiary Solid State Records, and single \"August Winterman.\" Their second release, 2004's New Medicines, heightened the band's profile considerably, however. Produced by Aaron Sprinkle (Emery, Acceptance), the album's sales were buoyed by the title track, which became a hit on MTV2 and Fuse TV. On these first two albums, music critics had a hard time classifying the band's music: genres from emo to post-hardcore to alternative rock were all tossed around with little consensus.\n",
      "The band was first signed by SRE Recordings in mid-2005. In an interview, Brandon Mills claimed that \"marketing-wise, it was a little challenging to have bands named Decyfer and Disciple on the same label\". Hence, they changed their name to Decyfer Down.\n",

In an interview with Family Christian Stores, Meany explained that a sermon was the inspiration for the band's name: \"...This man was preaching about how humans are really spirit beings encased in fleshly bodies. The term \"earth suit\" came up. At the time we liked it, and we took it.\" The two regularly performed at Café Joel, a small coffeehouse their church had started where Meany was music director.

      "After the release of the album, the band relocated permanently to the United States, settling in  San Diego, California in 2000. That year, a restructuring at their record label resulted in their becoming embroiled in a lawsuit which took over two years to resolve; during this time the band was prevented from recording any music. They then began recording a new album, but the studio where they were recording and all of their equipment and masters were destroyed in the Cedar Fire of 2003.

      "The band formed in 1998 in Pompano Beach, Florida after the breakup of the Christian hardcore band Strongarm. Strongarm guitarists Josh Colbert and Nick Dominguez, bassist Chad Neptune, and drummer Steve Kleisath recruited Vacant Andys vocalist Chris Carrabba to form Further Seems Forever. The first song the new band released was \"Vengeance Factor\" on the Deep Elm Records compilation An Ocean of Doubt: The Emo Diaries, Chapter Four, which contributed to the band's association with the emo genre. Their first release was a split EP with fellow Floridians Recess Theory entitled From the 27th State, released by Takehold Records, and soon the band had signed a recording contract with Seattle-based Christian label Tooth and Nail Records. By 2000, however, Carrabba had begun working on his own project Dashboard Confessional and recorded the album The Swiss Army Romance, essentially a solo release which he considered too personal for Further Seems Forever. At this time the band struggled with interpersonal squabbles and difficulties touring, as Dominguez had a young family and was reluctant to tour outside the state. This forced the group to search for several fill-in guitarists to replace him on tour. After returning from a solo tour in August 2000 Carrabba announced that he was leaving the group in order to focus on Dashboard Confessional full-time:\n",
      "Conrad, the guitarist and a primary songwriter of the band, decided to leave Ghoti Hook after the release of \"Banana Man\" and the subsequent tour promoting its release.  He left the band when the band began to tour full-time so he could finish seminary and continue with his accounting career. His last show was in the fall of 1997 at a show promoted by Javacasa in Lebanon, PA. Mark Lacasse joined on lead guitar in 1998 and helped to  write and record \"Two Years to Never\". Christian Ergueta left the band sometime after the recording of \"Two Years to Never\" with Mark leaving a few months later.\n",
      "Besides their music, Glowin' Moses most notable trait was their ever-changing roster. In 2000 the band expanded their roster from four to seven members. In addition to adding saxophonist Curtis Brown (who had already begun playing with the band in several concerts), the band added \"The Philipino Phenom\" Alden Lumagui on bass and \"Sugar\" Shawn Moseley on keyboards. This is the \"classic\" GM lineup that would remain intact for the next three years. In 2003 the band went through a series of lineup changes. Bassist Alden Lumagui left the band to pursue other personal and musical opportunities (he eventually resurfaced with the band Simple Life). Lumagui was \"replaced\" by a pastiche of fill-in bass players, including Michael Adams' brother, Brian. The band eventually settled on a steady lineup which featured Michael Adams on lead guitar, Ron Mason on bass guitar and Shawn Moseley on drums. In the Summer of 2003, the band added Shawn Downey as the permanent bass player. But the lineup changes weren't finished for the band. At the end of 2003 founding members Ray Fowler and Nathan Milton both departed the band for personal and professional reasons. Milton eventually returned to the music scene with his R&B/Soul collective, Mosaic. Following Milton's departure, Curtis Brown assumed the duties of lead singer and the band continued to record new music, resulting in the CD \"Grey\" (which included the final nine Adams-Milton collaborations).  In October 2005, Shawn Moseley and Shawn Downey decided to part ways with the band.  Brian Adams returned on Bass guitar, reducing GM back to its original number of four members. In 2005 the band also added keyboard player Vladimir Barrios. After a year of being in the band, Barrios left the group to return to his native home of California. In 2007, after eight years and four albums, the band decided to take an \"Indefinite Hiatus\".\n",

      "When the Guerilla Rodeo project came to an end, Reese reformed the band under his own name, Roper. Roper's full-length album, Brace Yourself for the Mediocre, was produced before the band was officially together and released on Five Minute Walk Records. All songs on the album with the exception of \"Day of Pigs\" and \"You're Still The One\" were written by Reese Roper, Masaki Liu, and Ethan Luck. Because of the incomplete state of the band at the time of the album's release, the only official member appearing on the CD is Reese Roper. As a result, the album features many additional musicians such as Frank Lenz (drums), Elijah Thomson (bass), Phil Bennett (organ), Bob Schiveley (guitar), Masaki Liu (guitar), Jason White (additional drums), Ethan Luck (guitar), and many additional vocalists. Some of the songs on the album were originally written for Guerilla Rodeo.

      "After playing in Halo for only two years, Graham was won over to the Christian faith in January 1982, and, with a unified mission to be a Christian band with a ministry, it was at this point that the group really started to take form.  Working to get their stride, Halo toured the Southern United States, performing mostly in Alabama, Tennessee, Florida and Georgia.  While playing the circuit, members of the band and friend Ken Headley (acting booking agent) were asked to attend a Petra concert in hope to meet the band and discuss Halo's desire to possible pursue ministry full-time.  The guys were told the band was on a tight schedule and could not make a meeting.  Ken, who had attended Samford University, ran into a past little sister in his fraternity, Kim Whisonant Hartman, now Bob Harmon's wife.  She was able to get a brief meeting and the guys handed him a demo tape.   A short time after the band received a call from Bob Hartman, founder and guitarist for perennial favorites in the Christian music industry, Petra. Hartman acted as a mentor to Halo, providing advice on song-writing as well as sound equipment. Despite their efforts and advice, Halo was still unsigned after nine years of touring, and their performances were effectively equal to a diversion that consumed many hours.\n",
      "Later in 1981, personal problems forced Williams to disband the original Harvest group - which at one time had numbered five.  The group was reformed as a duo of Williams and Kerr.  Williams and Kerr were together for the production of many records, including It's Alright Now, Send Us to the World, Voices, Only the Overcomers, Give Them Back, Holy Fire and Carry On.

      "The band replaced the members with Eric Wayne and Scott Soderstrom while continuing to tour. Wayne exited when Steven Patrick returned in 1991, but would again rejoin the group in 1995. Two years later, the band followed up their debut with Last Train.  While praised, it was not a commercial success. Although Last Train charted, peaking at the No. 10 slot on Billboard's CCM chart, the album did not meet the sales expectations of the label, and the band was dropped from their roster. A review in CCM magazine found that although the band's sound had progressed, their lyrics had shifted from evangelicalism to a more ambiguous tone. Additionally, the band was criticised by some in Christian music for attempting to be a \"crossover success\" into the general market.\n",

      "Their subsequent release, Skalleluia, became their most successful album and ranked the highest in record sales for the band. The album consists of contemporary praise and worship songs in ska and ska-punk renditions. Guest performances include Gene Eugene, Terry Scott Taylor, and Steve Taylor. Despite the fact that their initial formation centered around turning praise and worship songs into ska the album faced criticism for \"jumping on the bandwagon\" on praise and worship music's growing commercial appeal. Beyond charting on Billboard's \"Hot 200\" and \"Heatseekers\" charts and spending six months on their \"Top Contemporary Christian\" chart, their rendition of Rich Mullins' song \"Awesome God\" won the band a Dove Award for \"Hard Music Recorded Song of the Year\" in 1999. Some commercial success for the album was due in part to the use of recently written and widely known contemporary worship songs. Covers on the album include Twila Paris's \"We will Glorfiy\" and Keith Green's \"Oh, Lord, You're Beautiful\".\n",

Fearing a fundamentalist label, the band opted to remove the song from the album and replaced it with the more ambiguous \"About Sex, Part 2\". Despite this, the album was the group's best-selling record. They performed \"About Sex\" during a concert at Dellinger Park in Cartersville, GA.\n",

      "Perahia put together a new band for Surrender that included singer Jeff Fenholt. Surrender was released in 1985. Lyrically, the album marked a change in the band's style to lyrics which were evangelical and confrontational in nature. Rob Rock was involved with their third RCA Record album as Joshua, Intense Defense. In 1988, Intense Defense, which was recorded at Dierks Studios and produced by Frank Mono, was characterized by the editor of HM Magazine as being \"probably the best AOR melodic metal album in the universe.\" It sold well worldwide, but not in the United States. Following Intense, Perahia reformed the band as Jaguar. Jaguar included Robert Basauri (Robyn Kyle) on vocals, Joe Tafoya on drums, and Bryan Fleming on bass.

This started to spiral downward, and would have ended up much worse.  Fortunately, convinced of the family's need for God, the Moncivaiz father became born again.

Around this time, the group's music evolved from soul and doo wop into a harder guitar-driven mix of psychedelic rock, soul and funk, much influenced by the popular musical (and political) movements of the time. Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone were major inspirations. This style later evolved into a tighter guitar and horns-based funk (circa 1971–75), which subsequently, during the height of Parliament-Funkadelic success (circa 1976–81), added elements of R&B and electronic music, with fewer psychedelic rock elements. The band made their first live television performance on Say Brother in October 7, 1969.

With Smith's high octane violin and Pauline Adams' distinctive lispy vocals, the band toured the UK and Europe with Charisma stablemates Lindisfarne and Genesis. This exposure raised their profile and led to TV appearances and an American tour. A second album, The Machine That Cried, was recorded in February 1973 at IBC, but now with the addition of a drummer, Billy \"The Kid\" Fairley.

The release, along with the next few subsequent releases by the band, were of the death/doom metal sound, with the members being inspired and influenced by the rise of death metal becoming popular in Europe at the time. The release was enough of a hit in the underground metal scene to garner the attention of a small music label, Vic Records, which re-released it as an EP in 1993, which helped gain more exposure for the duo. The newfound popularity found them recruiting a bass guitarist, Guillaume Le Huche, so the trio could play live performances, and returning to the studio to recreate a debut full-length album. The resulting work, Dance of December Souls, was released in late 1993. The album's bleak melancholy and despair of their sound, continued to give them the classification of death/doom.\n",
      "Lake of Tears wowed critics and fans alike with their second recording, Headstones, released in 1995. The music underwent important changes, expanding on the riff-base of doom metal to achieve a more melodic and melancholic sound. The lyrics also explored new territory, intensely mournful and psychedelic fantasy imagery enhancing the album's heavy, autumnal soundscapes.\n",
      "Bohrer and Cavalier left the band and were replaced by Johnny Vines and Danny King, respectively. For the next four years, Lillian Axe toured extensively opening for bands such as Ratt, Poison and Queensryche. In 1987 at a show in Dallas, the band caught the eye of MCA Records and Marshall Berle (nephew of Milton Berle) who at the time was managing the band Ratt. MCA wanted to sign Steve, since he wrote the songs and owned the name. At the time, the band was experiencing some tensions due to addictions. Blaze recalled, “Quite honestly the way things were going at the time, some of the things had gotten so out of hand that I thought that we wouldn’t wind up lasting much longer in that capacity. It was chaotic at that time, a few of the guys had addiction issues and I had to make a decision to move forward.”\n",
      "In 2006 and 2009, Meshuggah was nominated for a Swedish Grammis Award for their albums Catch Thirtythree and obZen, respectively.

      "Their debut album, Suden Uni, recorded in early 2000, was released in early 2001, along with Tämä Ikuinen Talvi (\"This Everlasting Winter\"), a re-release of a 1999 demo. Suden Uni (\"A Wolf's Dream\") combined Finnish paganism and folk elements. After recruiting Mitja Harvilahti and Markus Eurén, Moonsorrow started playing live, releasing Voimasta Ja Kunniasta (\"Of Strength and Honour\") in late 2001. It was followed by their 2003 release, Kivenkantaja (\"Stonebearer\"), and Verisäkeet (\"Blood Verses\") in 2005.

      "Although they had been playing since 1989 under the name of \"Morbid God\", the band became Moonspell in 1992, shortly after they released the promo track \"Serpent Angel\".

Ribeiro and Ares were the founders and masterminds of Morbid God / Moonspell, while the latter members joined Morbid God at different points in 1992. Of them, only Mike Gaspar joined after the recording of \"Serpent Angel\".\n",
      "On July 25, 2016, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, with promoters claiming the band were on a hiatus and \"had no plans to play live or record again.\" This also led to cancelling their appearance at Ozzfest Meets Knotfest. Todd Jones later stated that the band had never taken a hiatus. In December 2016, the band returned by playing at The Power of the Riff festival and releasing a split 7\" with Full of Hell.\n",
      "The band’s first album was Sahara (1994) which was originally released as a demo.

It also included songs with traditional oriental Jewish piyyut and Arabic melodies. The album explored the themes of light and darkness, as well as conveying the message of commonality between the three main Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Islam, and Christianity).\n",
      "In an interview, Scott Hull claims that they picked the band name on the criteria that it was insulting, yet somewhat more creative than the name of his last band, Anal Cunt. Deciding that \"Cop Killer\" or \"Cop Destroyer\" would be tactless, they eventually settled on \"Pig Destroyer\" (\"pig\" being a pejorative American slang term for the police). Derived from a non-musical source as extreme as the band's sound, Pig Destroyer's easily identifiable logo was created using a graphic from ANSWER Me! magazine as a template. \nRelapse Records signed the band and issued a split 7\" with Isis on the label's Singles Series in July 2000. 38 Counts of Battery was a complete discography of Pig Destroyer releases up to the year 2000, which included split records with Gnob and influential screamo act Orchid, as well as their debut album, Explosions In Ward 6, and the demo that secured their record deal.\n",
      "In 1990, they debuted with their independently financed debut A Social Grace, which was released in Europe via a licensing deal with the German label Rising Sun Productions.  The album was very well received in Europe, being named album of the month in some European magazines,  The situation in the US was more difficult, as the album was released under the band's own Sub Sonic Records label.  With practically no promotion and minimal distribution, it remained an extremely underground item.  In May of 1991, the band appeared at the Dynamo Festival in the Netherlands.\n",
      "In October 2006, it was announced that Guillaume Bideau had left Scarve during the recording of The Undercurrent in order to take over as lead singer in the Danish industrial metal band Mnemic.

      "When cover bands consist of professional musicians, they often do not have a fixed lineup; rather, they are often made up of a flexible lineup of session musicians, utilizing \"dep\" (deputy, that is, stand-in) musicians where necessary. The music industry is considered by many musicians as a relatively difficult industry to make an income in, and cover bands can be a good source of income for professional musicians alongside other work.\n",

      "When the band played the New Music Seminar in NYC they signed a deal with Canadian record label Nettwerk Productions (who distributed their albums through IRS Records in the United States) and toured nationally, including being a support act for Nine Inch Nails. Called \"a seminal all-female group from the early '90s\" by some writers, singer Joan Osborne has covered their songs in concert and is a fan, so much so she would later make Deborah Schwartz her first signing on her Womanly Hips label.

It is important to note that mainstream local media/middle-of-the-road maligners of the group, were a mix of music reporters/columnists who were both female and male, uncomfortable with the sound and performance, not considered palatable at the time. The trend behind the attacks were based on the band's approach to their genderific sketch of themselves as Second Wave feminists, disrupting populist ideas of being, songwriting, language and image. The commercial and careerist alternative scenes made of hetero-normative and gay assimilationists were also most threatened. The few Canadians in the media championing were: Radio Hosts/Journalists; CKLN's Denise Benson, The Eye's Chris O'Connor, The Sun's John Sakamoto, The Globe and Mail's Liam Lacey, CBC Brave New Wave's hosts Brent Banbury and Kevin Komoda. The Fifth Column sound forged on Vinyl, would not be, without the deftness of Producers/Engineers: Peter D. Hudson (Dundrells), Walter Sobczak (Sturm Group), MP Wojewoda and the elusive Jack Freimanis. The aforementioned actualized the sound that Jones and Azar were aiming for. There were no female producers available or interested at that innate time in Toronto history and culture. There were many girls close to the group who were inspiring friends/muses, and many of them appeared in the music video \"Donna\", like Jena Von Brucker, Mic Hell, Norma Jean LeFebvre and Ottilie Mason. \n",

      "Before the formation of My Sister's Machine, guitarist Owen Wright and drummer Chris Gohde were involved in a band called Mistrust in 1984; this band also included former Culprit singer Jeff L'Heureux. They recorded one album called Spin the World, which was released on CD in 2009 by Heart of Steel Records. This band did an extensive amount of touring before they broke up in 1988.\n",
      "\"Jack Pepsi\" was released as a single, but Pepsi filed a lawsuit against the band due to the cover art on the single, which was the Pepsi logo with \"Tad\" in place of \"PEPSI.\" However, the so-called \"Pepsi logo\" was missing the left and right colorations in the actual Pepsi logo, one being of a light blue color; said light blue color never appeared on the Tad artwork, making this at best an attempt at \"folk art\", not even coming close to \"copyright infringement\". Another lawsuit was filed due to the cover of 8-Way Santa (which was a found picture of a man fondling a woman's breast). The couple in the photograph, one of whom had since become a born-again Christian and remarried, took exception and sued. Sub Pop subsequently changed the album cover to a shot of the band.\n",
      "They disbanded after recording eleven songs in November 1993. These songs were transferred from 2\" tape to digital by Stuart Hallerman at Avast!. Mark Spiders and Aaron Skok mixed the songs, and Black Guitar Records published the album, Underground, in 2018.\n",
      "In 1995, the band released its second album, Death To Traitors, on A&M Records, recorded as a three-piece following the departure of bass player Charles Bryan; guitarist Grant Fitch doubled up on bass for the recording. During this period, the band evolved by adding more instrumental and country elements to soften their hard rock edge. The band toured Europe and the UK in early 1995, as well as touring Australia in October 1995. While the album received favorable reviews from the press, sales were less successful, and Paw was dropped by A&M in 1996, before their contract was fulfilled.\n",
      "While initially rising to fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, further releases from the band expressed a variety of influences, including psychedelic rock, bossa nova and classic rock. The band's evolution throughout the 1990s and early 2000s involved periods of commercial highs and lows, brought about in part by Weiland's well-publicized struggles with drug addiction.\n",
      "The quartet's first single \"Little Darlin'\", is a widely regarded punk single. Then, the band released an EP, 1992's rollicking Budspawn, which was released independently on External Records. The material on Budspawn combined the four members' inherent punk aesthetics with a tendency toward more straight-ahead, anthemic hard rock and drug-induced psychedelia.\n",
      "Dandelion's music was featured on MTV, as videos for the songs \"Waiting for a Ride\", \"Under My Skin\", and \"Weird-Out\" entered late night rotation. The band's music was also featured on MTV shows The Real World and Beavis & Butt-head, as well as the Edward Furlong movie Brainscan. However, national fame eluded the band as their albums were released during the time of grunge's decline in popularity. Dandelion disbanded in 1996.\n",
      "The band released their first album, Love Tara, in 1993.\n",
      "Percussionist Robin Easton participated as drummer 14 in the Boredoms 77 Boadrum performance which occurred on July 7, 2007 at the Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park in Brooklyn, New York. That year King Cobb Steelie released an album, Destroy All Codes.\n",
      "They went through a series of temporary bassists, eventually settling on Vincent Leriche. The band originally called themselves \"Psychoz\", then \"6.35\", \"Station Désir\" and finally \"Noirs Désirs\" (to be changed later to Noir Désir). In 1982 Teyssot-Gay and Leriche left the group to form BAM (Boîte A Musique). The remaining band members, Barthe and Cantat, went in search of a replacement guitarist and bassist. For bass they found Frédéric Vidalenc, who had played in the well-known local group Dernier Métro, and eventually they settled on Luc Robène for guitar. (The following year Cantat also left the band temporarily, being replaced during his six-month absence by Emmanuel Ory-Weil, who later became the band's manager.) When Robène quit in 1985 Cantat succeeded in getting their original guitarist, Teyssot-Gay, back into the band. The new lineup of Cantat on vocals, Teyssot-Gay on guitar, Vidalenc on bass and Barthe on drums continued for 11 more years.\n",

The band went on tour with Genghis Tron and The Dillinger Escape Plan to support the album, but it was cut short by an injury of one of the members of The Dillinger Escape Plan. To help them recoup financial losses from that tour, Between the Buried and Me took the band on tour, supported by August Burns Red.\n",
      "Upon splitting up, guitarist Eddie Bertrand formed Eddie & the Showmen in 1964, while guitarist Paul Johnson later joined Cat Mother & the All Night Newsboys in 1970.  Original Bel-Airs drummer Dick Dodd joined Bertrand in Eddie & the Showmen, and later joined the Standells, playing drums and singing lead on their major 1966 hit, \"Dirty Water\".

      "In 1991, the band released two separate CDs at the same time: Burning The Hard City and Suspension & Displacement which \"show-cased the band's two extreme split personalities...The former was a bone-crushing excursion into heavy power rock with anarchistic guitar solos, and the latter was a brilliant diary of dark, eerie ambient soundscapes.\" (EXPOSE'). Three years later in 1994, Djam Karet released the CD Collaborator, with guests musicians: Jeff Greinke, Kit Watkins, Marc Anderson, Steve Roach, Carl Weingarten, and many others.\n",

The band entered the studio in early 2000 to record their debut album, Contradiction, which was recorded, like every other Dysrhythmia album to follow, completely live with minimal overdubs.  Shortly thereafter, the band reentered the studio in 2001 to record the No Interference record.  The new album helped to define and expand the band's sound, and was followed by extensive touring.  In 2002, the band released two split albums, a 10\" vinyl record with Thoughtstreams and a 7\" split with Technician.\n",
      "Carlson was a close friend of grunge icon Kurt Cobain, who sang lead vocals in the song \"Divine and Bright\", from a demo included on the re-release of the live album Sunn Amps and Smashed Guitars.

Former members Burn and Convertino started the band Calexico.\n",
      "The band name is a challenge to the \"Great man theory\" and a call for a paradigm shift. Rather than subscribe to the notion that \"highly influential individuals\" to whom monuments are built shape historical developments, the band name posits that it is actually the masses struggling for change who make history. In several interviews, that band has cited the American Civil Rights Movement as an example and note the hard work of hundreds of organizers that often gets overshadowed in history books by admittedly important individuals. The band members have often explained in interviews that their music is only one expression of their respective politics. Each member has been involved with various organizations throughout the life of the band, including the League of Filipino Students-SFSU, Challenging White Supremacy, Kalayaan School for Equity, BAYAN USA, and others.\n",

      "Füxa's first collaborative effort, which was immediately bracketed within the psychedelic and experimental category, was a collection of short, guitar and synth driven, primal instrumental space rock songs, recorded at home on a borrowed 6-track cassette recorder. The tapes were later brought to friend Erik Kassab of Gravity Wax for mixing and mastering at his Mission Control home studio. The resulting masters totaled over 90 minutes, and the best hours worth of music was selected for their first release, a hand colored, labeled and numbered cassette. This tape was sold at local indie record shops, and quite a few copies were given away by the band. College DJ Lunar Larry played many selections from this tape on his Friday night program, \"The Life According to Larry\", on WHFR radio. Nieman & Anderson at that time began to play at Detroit coffee houses, quickly building a cult following with their brief, psychedelic, erratic performances. The duo performed with the assistance of an old, literally falling apart Korg Mono/Poly synthesizer, often left to its own devices to produce loud, random arpeggios throughout the entire performance, which almost always emulated in a drum circle where audience participation was encouraged to \"feel good\" with the band. It has been suggested that the Detroit-based experimental rock band focus on a lo-fi, electronics-heavy blend of droning, treated guitars, vintage synths, and sparse percussion in the vein of suicide, Spacemen 3 / Spiritualized, and neu!.  Ryan Anderson departed from the outfit in 1998, and Randall Nieman took over Füxa as a solo project. In 2001-2003 Ryan Anderson Joined Delta Waves to play drums and perform on a few recordings.\n",

      "Gifts From Enola were one of the first bands to be signed by the influential indie record label The Mylene Sheath. In March 2008 Gifts From Enola released a split album with the post-rock band You.May.Die.In.The.Desert, which was titled Harmonic Motion Vol. 1 and was released nationwide through Differential Records. This was followed by a vinyl re-release of Loyal Eyes Betrayed the Mind by The Mylene Sheath on 3 June 2008. The re-release was a vinyl exclusive limited to 500 copies: 100 on clear vinyl with black and blue splatter available exclusively from the band at concerts, 150 on clear vinyl with gray haze and clear with white haze available exclusively from The Mylene Sheath webstore, and 250 on gray vinyl. Both of the exclusive versions sold out very quickly and the re-release cemented the band as a stalwart of the emerging post-rock genre. The release of both these albums increased both national and international appreciation of the band.\n",
      "In 2004, the pair moved to Santa Cruz, California. Shortly after arriving on the west coast Topham and Andreoli committed to working together under the name Giraffes?

On a typical day during the tour, Gone would perform one set at an in-store appearance, then go down to the venue where Black Flag were headlining, set up, and open the show.  Ginn's only break in the evening would be when the second opening band, Painted Willie, performed; he would then get onstage with Black Flag and play a 90-minute set.\n",
      "The band then released two self-financed EPs in 2000 and 2001. Paul Spitz left the US to travel in Turkey and Zak Riles joined as guitarist, often playing more of an acoustic role. In 2002 Hall sent a promotion CD to Neurot Recordings who were convinced of the band's potential.\n",

      "After years of viral self-promotion (such as phoning record companies pretending to be other bands who'd heard an interesting band called Karma To Burn), Karma To Burn was signed to Roadrunner Records in 1996. They were planning to release an entirely instrumental album, but Roadrunner insisted that the contract was only valid under the condition that they hired a vocalist. After a brief trial of then Kyuss frontman John Garcia, they hired a friend of theirs Jay Jarosz. Their first album Karma To Burn was released in 1997, and despite critical acclaim, sold poorly. The band decided to sack Jarosz and as such were fired from Roadrunner. The band continued, releasing 1999's Wild Wonderful Purgatory and 2001's Almost Heathen as entirely instrumental albums.\n",

      "In 2005, the band reconvened with Jerry Fuchs (Turing Machine, The Juan MacLean, !!!) stepping in on drums and Cherry re-joining on guitar. Fuchs' influence pushed the band towards a heavier, more psychedelic and space rock-influenced sound. Maserati toured the US and Europe throughout 2006 and 2007, playing with bands such as !!!, Battles, and Black Moth Super Rainbow.  The band signed with Temporary Residence in 2007, releasing their third album Inventions for the New Season later that year followed by the Inventions Remixes 12\" featuring remixes by Tim Goldsworthy and Justin Van Der Volgen.  In 2008 Scarborough left the group and was replaced by bassist Chris McNeal (Some Soviet Station, Vincas). In early 2009 Temporary Residence released the Maserati/Zombi split LP, followed by the rarities collection Passages later that year.

For their performance at the South by Southwest festival in their hometown in March 2010, the band put together a multi-media show which involved them performing material from what was to be their upcoming release, Hexadecagon. The band performed surrounded by eight loudspeakers, while eight projectors projected videos corresponding to the music on tent ceilings above the stage and the audience. Later that same year, the Octopus Project played at Moogfest 2010 in Asheville, North Carolina. They were scheduled to play just prior to Devo's headlining set. Three days prior to the concert, Devo's guitarist, Bob Mothersbaugh, severely injured his hand and was unable to play. Since the band was receiving a Moog Innovation Award at the festival, and because they didn't want to disappoint their fans, the remaining two members of Devo enlisted the help of The Octopus Project, and together the two bands performed the Devo songs \"Girl U Want\" and \"Beautiful World.\"\n",
      "In all of the band's early performances, guitarists Marc Miller and Natalio Fowler both stood on large black boxes (or pedestals) towering over the audiences, a nod to the superiority complexes of rock bands. They would occasionally step down from the boxes to walk into the audience and stand in front of individuals in the crowd (while still playing) in an attempt to make them feel uncomfortable. This was later aided by the much self-publicized acquisition of wireless guitars. Drummer Christopher Freeland would intermittently get up from his set and barge around the stage, mumbling incoherent babble, only to sit back down and lunge into another song. Miller and Fowler are noted for having the birth and death dates of Jimi Hendrix respectively. \n",

      "Although the band played typical technical metal with a vocalist in Houston, Letchford and Levrier noted a change in their sound when they started writing again in Los Angeles. After writing their first song, \"Rode In on Horseback\",  the duo realized the material sounded as if it was already complete, without being written for a singer, and so the duo dismissed the idea of finding another singer. The duo took two years of classes at the Institute, where their new band recorded four songs on a demo and played shows around the town. To make it easier to pursue a career in the band, Letchford and Levrier convinced Eberhardt and Skeffington, whom they had never met before attending school, to move to Houston with them instead of basing the band in Los Angeles. Letchford later explained that despite enjoying the area's natural beauty he felt the music scene in Los Angeles was too crowded and difficult to survive in. The band's formation was temporarily threatened by Levrier finding work for a band called Into the Moat, which he considered joining permanently, but Letchford sent him a demo recording of the song \"Omni\" (a song that would appear on the band's debut album, Monument), and Levrier changed his mind. Into the Moat disbanded in spite of touring with acts such as Between the Buried and Me and The Black Dahlia Murder. Levrier coined the name \"Scale the Summit\" when he perused a photography book and saw a picture titled \"The Summit\", and mentioned the name as soon as it came to mind; the group took the name immediately.\n",

      "Returning from touring the United States in the autumn of 2000, the group stepped into the studio for the third time. This time with a mind to create an EP release that captured the mood of the tour. In fact the EP, entitled, The Trial of St. Orange, has a great deal more varied material, including a drum 'n bass mix. Pink Abyss, dubbed by the band as their \"pop\" record, was released in January 2004. In 2005, they released their fourth album, Unfortunately.\n",
      "The band has been through a plethora of line-up changes, and minor positions in the band have proved to be a revolving chair, while retaining the core force of the Karpinski brothers and Tim Gerak. Former vibraphonist Eric Koltnow left the band after the release of Everywhere and Right Here, as well as former lap steel player Ben Vaughan after the birth of his first child. Minor positions, such as the newly-added trumpet, have been filled by members of other bands from the Akron, Ohio area.\n",

Originally, we had written a couple songs for the album that were shorter, a bit chill compared to our normal stuff, and had more pop based structures. Since we didn't really plan on playing those two songs live, we thought it'd be cool to get Kurt Travis, who I used to play with in Dance Gavin Dance, to collaborate on a full song for old time’s sake.\"",

      "With a settled line up – Go Kurosawa (drums, vox), Tomo Katsurada (guitar, vox), Kotsuguy (bass), Daoud Popal (guitar), Ryu Kurosawa (sitar), –\nand a signature sound that blended classical Indian music, Krautrock, traditional folk, 70s rock, and acid-tinged psych, the band sold out shows across Europe and founded their own label, Guruguru Brain, to showcase not just their own work, but the under-represented music scene in East Asia. To date, the label has released music from over ten different artists alongside their own albums, and in 2017 Kurosawa and Katsurada relocating permanently to Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The move placed both Kikagaku Moyo and Guruguru Brain at the heart of Europe and eased the logistical challenges of long tours for bands on their label and release schedules while catering to Western audiences.\n",

      "Lake Trout's third album, Alone at Last - Live with DJ Who is a live album and was recorded on December 9, 1999 at Trax in Charlottesville, Virginia.  It was released by Phoenix Rising Records in 2000.  This album, as would be expected with the addition of a DJ, has a harder and more electronic sound than the band's earlier work.  It has a slightly darker feel than the previous two records and incorporates elements of drum and bass music into the sound. Mike Lowry has stated that Amon Tobin was a significant influence on him at the time, driving his development of breakbeat and jungle drumming techniques and textures. The group's electronic experiments influenced the developing livetronica scene, although Lowry told Relix magazine in 2014 that the group \"never really felt  a part of that scene.\"\n",

      "In the fall of 1994, the band reconvened as undergrads at Berklee and attempted to play at various Boston jazz clubs, walking in and asking the club owners and other musicians if they would \"let us play\", giving birth to the name Lettuce. Matt Butler played keyboards with the band early on and then Jeff Bhasker took on the role. When he left, Neal Evans joined.\n",
      "The album, Hammerstrike was released on SCI Fidelity in 2008 to positive reviews. The band followed the album's release with a forty seven-date North American tour.  On Oct. 6, 2009 Lotus released a set of 2 EPs titled Oil on Glass/Feather on Wood featuring music recorded during the Hammerstrike sessions and 3 remixes of tracks from Hammerstrike. Before the band's 2009 fall tour, original drummer Steve Clemens left the band and was replaced by current drummer Mike Greenfield. The loss of Clemens triggered a gradual departure from the band's improvisational roots and a stylistic shift from organic electronica and jazz/funk fusion to electro-pop, indie rock and hip-hop.\n",
      "After Tommy Caldwell was killed in a car accident in 1980, he was replaced by bassist Franklin Wilkie. Most of the original band members had left by the mid-1980s to pursue other projects.

      "Although the members of the Moshav Band grew up playing music together, the band had its first official show at Jerusalem's Mike's Place in 1996, performing for an audience consisting mainly of American students studying abroad in various yeshivas as well as Hebrew University. The organizer of the event, Sharon Goldman, was unsure how to bill the as-yet unnamed act and opted for the simple \"Moshav Band.\"  The name stuck.\n",
      "These bands played throughout 1990, but in early 1991, Tim, Greg, Isaac and Mike got back together and got serious about being a rock band. It didn't take long to step up from parties in Chico, CA to local bars and dance clubs like LaSalles and Juanita's. They began playing original songs rather than covers. The band released Back to the Grotto in February 1993. It was produced by the band with Bay Area-based musician/producer Paul Hoaglin (who would subsequently replace Parsons on bass upon his departure in 2002).\n",

At the time, the Alliance also featured bassist Ebo Walker and fiddler Lonnie Peerce. Within a year after Bush's and Johnson's arrival, Curtis Burch (dobro, guitar, vocals) joined the band. In 1972, Peerce left the band, and the remaining members decided to continue under the new name New Grass Revival. The band released their eponymous debut album The Arrival of the New Grass Revival later in 1972 on Starday Records.\n",
      "Inspired by American folk music, rock and roll, and blues, Garcia formed the Grateful Dead (initially known as The Warlocks) with blues singer Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan, while Nelson joined the similarly inclined New Delhi River Band (which would eventually come to include bassist Dave Torbert) shortly thereafter. Although they lacked the managerial acumen and cultural cachet of the Grateful Dead and elected to remain in East Palo Alto, California unlike the former group, which soon relocated to the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, the New Delhi River Band were considered by late 1966 to be the house band of The Barn (one of the region's few viable concert venues outside of San Francisco) in Scotts Valley, California. The group continued to enjoy a cult following in Santa Clara and Santa Cruz Counties through the Summer of Love until their dissolution in early 1968.\n",
      "The musical compositions that the band creates are influenced by everything from jazz, to Latin themes, to Indian music. Strong vocals and harmonies, electric and acoustic guitars, banjo, mandolin, bass and keyboards, unify the musical styles of New Monsoon's influences, which are as diverse as rock gods The Allman Brothers Band, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Neil Young, and Carlos Santana, bluesmen Mississippi John Hurt and Blind Willie McTell, American icons Tom Waits, J. J. Cale, and Jerry Garcia, jazz legends Elvin Jones, Thelonious Monk, and Horace Silver, and fusion pioneers Jeff Beck, Airto Moreira, and Weather Report. In their live shows, the band tries to provide a \"synthesis of genres, everything from bluegrass to reggae, funk, and rock 'n' roll.\" In 2004, Jambase.com presented the band with an award for Emerging Artist of the Year for 2003. The band has gone on to play at numerous festivals, including Bonnaroo, the Austin City Limits Festival, Telluride Bluegrass Festival, Old Settler's Music Festival, Wakarusa, Summerfest, High Sierra, Saturday in the Park, Langerado, 10000 Lakes Festival, and participated in the 2004, 2006, and 2008 Jamcruise trips.\n",

      "The group made a name for itself and built an enthusiastic fan base, known as Particle People, by performing energetic late-night sets at festivals such as Bonnaroo, where they played a set of over five hours to 20,000 people. They played up to 140 shows a year, often to large audiences. Reliance on word of mouth from fans, rather than advertising, allowed this group to sell out venues such as the Bowery Ballroom in New York City before they finally released their much anticipated first album, Launchpad, in early 2004, on which they worked with producer Tom Rothrock. In April and May 2005 the group toured with former Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart as Hydra; the tour received mixed reviews from many Deadheads who were unaccustomed to Particle's electronic-based approach. Bassist Phil Lesh, also of the Grateful Dead, sat in with the band that summer.\n",

      "The Samples embarked on their first national tour in the summer of 1988 and gradually gained attention. The band played mostly to college audiences and allowed their music to be spread through bootlegging and taping. Fans in college towns formed street teams to distribute the band's music and help them get shows by popular demand. Their debut self-titled album The Samples was independently recorded with producer Walt Beery and was released independently in early 1989. The album combined reggae, pop-rock, and bluegrass with a tight and polished sound that was often compared to The Police. Following the release, they signed with Arista Records and re-released the same album in May. However, the band found itself at odds with Arista's personnel, who neglected to market their debut album and wanted to change their sound. After an unproductive studio session with an outside producer hired by the label, band terminated their contract with Arista in the fall of 1991 and continued to tour unsigned.

      "In 2007, Vampire Weekend's song \"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\" was ranked 67th on Rolling Stone's list of the \"100 Best Songs of the Year\". In November 2007, they toured the UK with The Shins.\nThe then-nascent influence of blog hype and internet buzz played a role in their success and led to a large prerelease following sufficient to support them performing on three tours before their debut album was released. They were declared \"The Year's Best New Band\" by Spin magazine in the March 2008 issue, and were the first band to be shot for the cover of the magazine before releasing their debut album. The band made a television appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman on February 1, 2008, and on March 8, 2008, performed on Saturday Night Live. Four songs from the band's first album also made the Triple J Hottest 100, 2008. The internet hype had its backlash, however, as critics reacted against a perceived image of Vampire Weekend as privileged, upper-class Ivy League graduates stealing from foreign musicians. One critic went so far as to call Vampire Weekend the \"whitest band in the world,\" to which they took exception, given their Ukrainian, Persian, Italian, and Hungarian heritages. Koenig responded in a November 2009 interview by saying, \"Nobody in our band is a WASP.\" Furthermore, the backlash involving their social backgrounds was largely unfounded, as Koenig explained in the interview that the band members got into Columbia on scholarship and used student loans; he himself was still paying off student loans in 2009.\n",

Jordan claimed that the band's goal was to spread a message of brotherhood and harmony, using instruments and voices to speak out against racism, hunger, gangs, crimes, and turf wars, and promote hope and the spirit of brotherhood. Eric Burdon and War began playing live shows to audiences throughout Southern California before entering into the studio to record their debut album Eric Burdon Declares \"War\".

      "Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n",

The band then recorded its second album with Steve Albini which was never released because of artistic differences between the band and the record company. Despite their record company's urgings, Charles and Bloedow did not want to give the recording a more commercial feel, prompting a split with Radioactive/Universal, who retain the recording. Charles said, \"We made our second full length with Steve Albini. It wasn't at all what the label was looking for, or wanted. The label wanted us to redo things, go in with more commercial people, and give them songs that they could sell. I didn't want to mess with what we made with Steve. It was what it was. In the end we agreed to disagree, I asked to be released from my contract, and we parted ways. For now it sits in some vault gathering dust, I suppose.\"\n",

      "David Gates was from Tulsa, Oklahoma. He released a song in the late 1950s entitled  \"Jo-Baby\"/\"Lovin' at Night\". Gates knew Leon Russell and both played in bar bands around the Tulsa area.  Both Gates and Russell headed for California to check out the music scene there. Before forming Bread, Gates had worked with Royer's previous band, the Pleasure Fair, who recorded one album for the UNI Records label with Gates producing and arranging. Royer then introduced Gates to his songwriting partner, Griffin, and the trio joined together in 1968 and signed with Elektra Records in January 1969. The group's first single, \"Dismal Day\", was released in June 1969 but did not chart. Their debut album, Bread, was released in September 1969 and peaked at No. 127 on the Billboard 200. Songwriting on the album was split evenly between Gates and the team of Griffin-Royer. Session musicians Jim Gordon and Ron Edgar accompanied the band on drums for the album.\n",

      "Since the early 1970s, numerous personnel changes have occurred. For much of the 1990s and 2000s and following Larry Taylor's death in 2019, de la Parra has been the only member from the band's 1960s lineup. He wrote a book about the band's career, titled Living the Blues. Mandel, Walter Trout and Junior Watson are among the guitarists who gained fame for playing in later editions of the band.\n",
      "Consisting of George (September 26, 1931 - October 12, 2019) on washtub bass (later on Danelectro bass guitar), Lester (b. April 13, 1940) on harmonica, and Willie (b. March 3, 1938) and Joe (b. August 22, 1942) on guitar, the group started to venture outside the gospel circuit, playing at coffeehouses that booked folk acts. They played at places like The Ash Grove, a very popular Los Angeles folk club. It became one of their favorite haunts and brought them into contact with Hoyt Axton, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Reverend Gary Davis, and Barbara Dane. Dane became a great supporter, performing and recording with the brothers. With the addition of Brian Keenan (January 28, 1943 – October 5, 1985) on drums, Dane took them on tour with her and introduced them to Pete Seeger, who helped put the Chambers Brothers on the bill of the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. One of the songs they performed, \"I Got It\", appeared on the Newport Folk Festival 1965 compilation LP, which was issued on the Vanguard label.\n",

      "\"Full doses of China White ... send staggering chills through your veins as you experience this nitro-punk injection.\"",
      "Chokebore released their debut single \"Nobody / Throats to Hit\" and their first full-length Motionless later that year. Their changing tempos and moody outbursts were unlike many other AmRep bands at the time, but their more furious and quicker paced moments aligned themselves just enough. They toured with Guzzard and Today Is The Day as well as with other more well-known like-minded bands, including the Butthole Surfers, Samiam, Girls Against Boys and Nirvana on their last 10 American shows.\n",
      "Following the release of Only Theatre of Pain, Christian Death's line-up had fallen apart, and by the time of the band's second album, Catastrophe Ballet (1984), Rozz was joined by Valor Kand of tour mates Pompeii 99 on vocals and guitar. Following the release of the band's third album, Ashes, in 1985, Williams left the band and was controversially replaced by Valor as frontperson of the band, with no original members of the band remaining, causing a divide in the band's fanbase that has continued to this day.\n",
      "Greg Lindstrom, Robert Garven, Jerry Fogle and Pat Galligan (later a guitarist in Angry Samoans) played in Titanic, their first band in junior high school.

      "The band recorded various demos and filmed a music video for their single \"Cheating B**ch\". The publicity eventually allowed the band to play many different Los Angeles venues, including The Whiskey A Go Go, The Roxy Theater, The El Rey Theatre, The Troubadour and other various bars and clubs on the Sunset Strip. In early 2008, the band began writing music for their first, full-length EP, which would eventually become From The Garage to Your Speakers.  During the writing process, Joshua Cruz contacted Tomas Costanza, producer, vocalist and guitarist for the band Diffuser, to discuss the possibility of working with the band on the record.  After reviewing the band's demos, Tomas Costanza agreed to produce the record.\n",
      "The members of Cold War Kids met at Biola University. They formed a band in 2004 when they would meet regularly in Jonnie Russell's apartment above a restaurant called Mulberry Street in downtown Fullerton. Maust came up with the band's name around 1997, during his travels in Eastern Europe with his brother, where they found a park in Budapest with missing statues, taken away after Communism fell. Seeing that there was a playground in the park, Maust said \"...being in that environment just made the phrase 'Cold War Kids' pop into my head. I may have heard it before. I'm a Cold War kid, too – I was born in 1979.\" Maust used the name for his personal website, but then he repurposed it after the band decided to use the name. The band relocated to Whittier, California, and began recording their first demo, which Monarchy Music released as the EP Mulberry Street (based on the restaurant where they regularly met) in spring 2005. Between tours, the band released two more EPs: With Our Wallets Full and Up in Rags, in 2006. Monarchy Music would re-release those EPs as one compilation album titled Up in Rags/With Our Wallets Full in 2006.\n",

      "Their first demo, Life in Grave, was produced in 1985 and became well circulated in the burgeoning tape-trader underground. Their first full-length LP, Convicted, was released in 1986 on Death/Metal Blade records, whose artist roster also boasted D.R.I., Corrosion of Conformity, Dr. Know, The Mentors, and Beyond Possession. Within its first year of release, Convicted sold over 25,000 copies and earned Cryptic Slaughter the reputation as being one of the fastest bands in hardcore. Next came Money Talks in 1987, which is still considered by many to be the band's best effort. Mixing crushing grooves with lightning speed, Money Talks surpassed Convicted's success by selling 35,000 in its first year and by earning Cryptic Slaughter a fanatical following around the world. They took on the right-wing theocracy directly, with songs like \"Freedom of Expression\" that skewered the censorial nature of the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), founded by Al Gore's wife Tipper.  Their \"American Heroes\" directly confronted the mass media heroic mythology of the astronauts who died in the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, when millions toil to survive daily in a world of injustice.  Along with DRI they were at the forefront of a musical genre known as much for its relentless energy as its radical anti-authoritarian politics, even if not all the listeners paid attention.\n",
      "The band's self-titled album, Cruzados, was released in 1985.\n",
      "Over the course of the next few years, the band built up a small local fan base and self-released their first EP, A Cursive Memory. It featured the original version of The Piano Song. In 2005 the band self-released the Lights, Camera, Action EP.

The song Club Revolution Remix was featured on an episode of The Real World.\n",
      "In November 1986, Dark Angel released their second studio album, Darkness Descends, which is widely considered to be their seminal release. Around the same, several other thrash metal bands such as Metallica also released seminal albums and started to gain more popularity. Although Darkness Descends did not initially reach the Billboard 200 charts or become a commercial success, Dark Angel spent most of 1986 and 1987 touring heavily behind the album, with bands like Motörhead, Megadeth, Possessed, Slayer, Overkill, Sacred Reich, Whiplash, Cryptic Slaughter and The Crumbsuckers. After the Darkness Descends tour ended in August 1987, vocalist Don Doty left Dark Angel in order to start a family and was replaced by Ron Rinehart, who would stay with the band until their breakup in 1992 and rejoin for their subsequent reunions. Dark Angel performed their first show with Rinehart at the Fender's Ballroom in Long Beach, California on January 29, 1988.\n",
      "Having heard the band's first album, John Peel asked the band to record a Peel Session. Unable to afford to tour internationally, the band recorded their session in Fugazi's home studio using an 8-track recorder previously owned by Minor Threat, the first time a Peel Session was recorded outside the BBC studios.

      "As a teenager, Stan Lee was a drug buddy of Iggy Pop, once accepting the well known \"leopard\" jacket that the latter wore in the Stooges as payment for heroin. Surprisingly, it was not hanging out with Iggy Pop that pushed Lee into joining the nascent punk scene, but rather it was the experience of going with eventual Dickies bassist Billy Club (Bill Remar) to see The Damned on their first American tour that proved most influential. Exposure to the music of the Ramones and the Weirdos was seminal as well. Prior to deciding on a punk rock direction, Lee had begun to learn guitar, at the urging of friend Kevin DuBrow, with the ambition of becoming a Ritchie Blackmore-like virtuoso. His teacher, Huffsteter, suggested that playing punk was a more practical idea, and by way of convincing, provided Lee with his initial introduction to the music of the Ramones. Lee and Club rounded out their initial punk band lineup with Phillips, multi-instrumentalist Chuck Wagon, and drummer Karlos Kaballero (Carlos Caballero), who came up with the name \"Dickies\" (Lee preferred \"the Imbeciles\"), and the band made their live debut at the Whisky a Go Go in September 1977. The Dickies were among the first punk rock bands to emerge from Los Angeles. They were the first California punk band to appear on network television (C.P.O. Sharkey), and the first California punk band to be signed to a major record label (A&M Records).\n",

      "Following his departure from Fear Factory in 2002, guitarist Dino Cazares was looking for a drummer that \"fit in\" with the band. First he tried drummers John Sankey from Devolved and Nicholas Barker from the bands Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir. But both drummers had to return to their homelands of Australia and England respectively due to visa issues. He then met former Vital Remains drummer Tim Yeung. Cazares and Yeung recorded the material they wrote and sent tapes to Cummings for his vocal audition. Cazares comments \"We heard passion and anger in his voice, which was something we wanted. It was also very aggressive.\"\nDivine Heresy held auditions for a permanent bassist — Tony Campos of Static-X played bass on three songs and Cazares acted as bassist on the remaining songs. Following unsuccessful auditions, Cazares was contacted by former Nile bassist Joe Payne. Cazares knew Joe Payne from seeing him play live with Nile. After auditioning, Joe Payne joined Divine Heresy as the permanent bass guitarist.\n",

Pitchfork described the songs as \"genuine earworms, both unfailingly hip and often wonderfully associative\". Dee Dee produced the record with Richard Gottehrer, who had previously worked with Richard Hell, Blondie, the Go-Gos and the Raveonettes. Gottehrer also co-wrote the early 1960s hit songs \"My Boyfriend's Back\" and \"I Want Candy\". The record included guest guitarists Nick Zinner of Yeah Yeah Yeahs on \"Yours Alone\"; Dee Dee's ex-husband, Brandon Welchez of Crocodiles, on \"Blank Girl\"; and Andrew Miller on multiple tracks. The cover of the album featured a college snapshot of Dee Dee's mother, who died from cancer in 2010. After its release, Dee Dee assembled a touring band, and their first shows were in support of Girls.\n",
      "Eels were officially founded when Butch and E met Tommy Walter. The name \"Eels\" was chosen so that the band's records would be close to E's solo records in an alphabetical ordering, although it was too late once they realized that numerous Eagles and Earth, Wind and Fire releases were in between. Eels became one of the first groups to sign a record deal with DreamWorks Records, followed by Elliott Smith.\n",

In the summer of 2010, the band placed three songs off the EP on ABC's top-rated teen drama Pretty Little Liars.\n",
      "Stevens picked the name \"The Exies\" from a John Lennon biography, stating on Rockline (11/9/2002) that it was the only Beatles-related name left that was not taken. When the Beatles were touring around Hamburg, Germany in the 1960s, they encountered three distinct social groups among the kids: the mods, the rockers, and the art students (who referred to themselves as \"the existentialists\"). John Lennon coined the term \"the exies\" to refer to the art students.\n",

      "Fishbone got started in 1979 as a \"disparate, all-black oddball crew\" when the members were in junior high school. The Fisher brothers, Jones, Dowd, and Kibby were all from South Central Los Angeles and were included in a school busing program that sent them daily to the San Fernando Valley, where they met Moore, who was native to the area. After first using the name Megatron with Titus Norris on vocals, the sextet adopted the name Fishbone and formed a unique stew of different styles that became popular in the Los Angeles club scene and was a great influence on several subsequent alternative bands. Their first club date was at Madame Wong's, the influential venue in Los Angeles's Chinatown that had been a showcase for a variety of seminal punk bands in the 1980s. They formed strong friendships with Los Angeles bands like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Thelonious Monster, and Psi Com. Fishbone were signed to Columbia Records in 1983 after being spotted at a club gig by Brian O'Neal of The BusBoys.

Putting Dave's poetic lyrics to rocking melodies, they played at a Los Angeles pub called Molly Malone's weekly, building a small but loyal following. Together, they wrote songs such as \"Black Friday Rule\" and \"Selfish Man\", which was the beginning of Flogging Molly's sound. Ted and Jeff then left Flogging Molly because an earlier band of theirs, Reacharound, received a record deal.  Dave and Bridget began to find new members and the current band was formed.\n",

      "Grouplove formed out of a friendship among the five members of the band. Hooper met Zucconi on the Lower East Side of Manhattan after hearing and enjoying his music from his former band ALOKE. Despite having just met, Hooper invited Zucconi to an artist residency in Crete she was leaving for later that week.  It was at the Ikarus artist commune in the village of Avdou where they met the rest of the band, Andrew Wessen, Ryan Rabin, and Sean Gadd. Rabin, an accomplished drummer and producer, grew up in Los Angeles with Wessen, a surfer and guitarist. Rabin comes from a musical family – his father is Trevor Rabin, former guitarist of Yes. Sean Gadd, a songwriter and guitarist from London, was also at the commune. The friendship between the members formed quickly, but the band did not form until a year later after Gadd, Zucconi and Hooper pooled their funds together and made a trip to Rabin's Los Angeles recording studio. They played their first show at El Cid in Los Angeles on May 10, 2010.

      "In the early 1990s the band released two albums.  First, they released an 8-song self-produced and self-titled album \"Half Way Home,\" as gift for their large following of loyal fans.  This 1992 first release was very limited and was only sold at shows and through the mail.  In fact, Half Way Home was one of the earliest bands to attempt to build their fan base through direct marketing and band loyalty, using mailing lists, 800 numbers, and alternative avenues to promote their new album. The second album, released through Geffen Records in 1993, and also titled \"Half Way Home,\" was reviewed positively by critics, but was heavily produced with little effective input from the band. The album sold poorly and was not promoted heavily by Geffen because of the newly found grunge scene that came alive around the same time, and also because of the \"grassroots\" marketing approach Geffen chose to take. The band broke up in 1994 though some members of the band were auditioning for a new singer as early as 1993. The band has never reunited and the band name was officially cancelled in 1998.\n",
      "Haunted Garage was formed in 1985 by vocalist Dukey Flyswatter (stage name of Michael Sonye), bassist Ace McCoomba and guitarist Nyck Varoom. Initially, the band started out in a psychedelic/rockabilly style, playing covers of theme songs from vintage B movies (\"You know, 'The South Is Gonna Rise Again' from Two Thousand Maniacs!, and 'Hideous Sun Demon' and 'The Blob' and stuff like that\", according to Flyswatter) before eventually writing original material in a similar B movie-inspired vein. Following the addition of transvestite lead guitarist Gaby Godhead and drummer Stiff Slug, Haunted Garage's sound evolved into a more aggressive fusion of horror punk and heavy metal, a mix which the Los Angeles Times described as \"The Dickies doing Alice Cooper\" but which Flyswatter referred to as \"splatter punk\".\n",
      "Health first gained reputation through a remix of their song \"Crimewave\" by experimental electronic band Crystal Castles in August 2007. The rendition helped broaden Health's audience in anticipation for their full-length debut a month later released under Lovepump United. The band's self-titled album was recorded in L.A.’s noise/experimental venue, The Smell. Known for its DIY mystique, Health knew how difficult, yet rewarding, it would be to record in the space. Famiglietti said in an interview, \"The room completely changes the tone of anything you want to record; makes a lot of things dark and beautiful. It also makes everything sound like 'CLANG!' We didn't realize how hard it would be at all, we especially weren't prepared for the Vaquero bar dropping the reggaeton jamz at 1pm every day.\" Their unique sound on the album caught the attention of Spin in which they wrote, \"The near-innocuous opening track of Health's self-titled album, 'Heaven,' segues into the 36-second neurotic dissonance of 'Girl Attorney,' which picks up tempo on its transition into 'Triceratops'—a thrashing scourge of screeches, feedback, and gratuitous clanging reminiscent of Liars laced with a relief of a Deerhunter meditation.\"\n",

In 2015, the guitarist Aaron Owens died as well. Hepcat continues performing at concerts and festivals, but infrequently.\n",
      "The group rehearsed and experimented for several months in the San Fernando Valley garage of a disc-jockey friend, collaborating on new material and reworking classics. Vincent's songs explored themes of alienation and angst, propelled by the raw, unrelenting, and occasionally Bartókian backdrop of an extremely loud power trio. In fact, the band was so loud that Cobb suggested rehearsing with headsets, a practice which became part of the group's signature in their rare, live performances as well.\n",
      "\"Honk had a reputation for being a musician's kind of band,\" Stekol said. \"It was a lot of fun. Honk's problem was with the business, not the players. No one had any difficulty with anyone else in the band. But no one had the ego to stay with it when things weren't working.\"",

Laner then assembled a band of musicians from the Los Angeles music scene. Medicine's early lineup included Laner, drummer Jim Goodall (Severed Head in a Bag, Jon Wayne, Lopez Beatles), guitarist Jim Putnam, bassist Eddie Ruscha and singer Annette Zilinskas (an original member of the Bangles). Zilinskas left before any official releases and was replaced by former Fourwaycross singer Beth Thompson. On the basis of the original demo, the band were signed to Creation Records, becoming the first American band to do so. In America, Medicine signed to Rick Rubin's American Recordings label in 1992. With a signature guitar tone, created by running Laner's guitar through a Yamaha 4-track recorder, Medicine's music managed to distinguish itself from some of the more ambiguous endeavors of the shoegaze movement.\n",

During the mid-1980s, the band changed line-ups and adopted a more pop oriented style, until a significant genre change to alternative rock in 1994.

      "Plexi was said to have formed in 1993 when Michael Angelos, a former USC film student, met guitarist Michael Barragan in an L.A. bar and drummer Norm Block at a Taoist retreat.  However, most of the band's inscrutable Sub Pop bio (i.e. a part about a Hasidic motorcycle gang) was fabricated for comedic value. In 1994, they recorded their first EP for the indie label Boys Life. As evidence of the band's dryly nonchalant humor, a 1995 magazine ad for the EP read, \"If you buy only one album this year... Buy Nick Drake's Five Leaves Left.\"  In a mere four days in January 1995, the band recorded a second EP. It was released by the Seattle label I.F.A., corresponding with a tour opening for Archers of Loaf. The EPs attracted attention from larger independent labels, culminating in their \"discovery\" by a friend of Sub Pop band Sunny Day Real Estate, Curtis W. Pitts.  Plexi later claimed that \"I.F.A.\" stood for either \"I'll Fight Anyone\" or \"I'll Fuck Anything\". Cats were prominently featured in the artwork for both EPs.\n",
      "The band was formed in 1977 and was a contemporary of the bands featured in the film The Decline of Western Civilization.

The Plugz are generally acknowledged as being the first D.I.Y. punk band in L.A., having started their own PLUGZ RECORDS and later Fatima records.\n",

      "Following the demise of the critically and commercially successful Jane's Addiction, frontman Perry Farrell and drummer Stephen Perkins formed Porno for Pyros after acquiring guitarist Peter DiStefano and bass player Martyn LeNoble. Farrell named the band after seeing an ad for fireworks in a pornographic magazine. The name has also been connected through song lyrics to the LA riots which occurred in the band's hometown around the time of Porno for Pyros inception.  Prior to releasing their eponymous first album, Porno for Pyros embarked on a nationwide tour to support the new band. By the time the band's debut album was released in 1993, anticipation surrounding the project was enough to briefly drive the album to the No. 3 position on the Billboard top 200 list. The video for the album's second single, \"Pets\", received heavy airplay on MTV. Following the album's release, Porno for Pyros continued a heavy touring schedule, including an appearance at Woodstock '94 along with a cameo on HBO's The Larry Sanders Show. Unlike the relatively straight-ahead rock shows that were the hallmark of live Jane's Addiction, Porno for Pyros live shows relied heavily on props, extras and special effects (including pyrotechnics).\n",

Additional copies of the cassette were manufactured and sold at Psi Com concerts. Robinson and Leyssius left after the demo recording. The drummer ad was left in The Recycler because the band was still practicing with the aid of a drum machine. Sherer called Farrell in response to the ad, and after he finally joined Duran and Farrell, Psi Com played their first significant live show, opening for the Cult at L.A.'s Music Machine club on August 1, 1984.

With Quirarte and Sherwood, van Dyk recorded an instrumental which was released as one of the winners of the contest to members of Dream Theater's fan club at the time. Energized by the experience, van Dyk wrote more music which reflected significant musical growth from the band's initial release as well as lyrics that were more contemplative first-person accounts of real life experience instead of the third party storytelling that made up the bulk of the band's first record. With the working title of The Fullness of Time, the band recorded the music and before they could approach Corey Brown to determine if he would sing on it, Ray Alder said that he felt the material was strong enough to join the band. \n",

      "The original line up of The Skulls formed in late 1976 and consisted of Danny Death on guitar, Framin'J on bass, Victor Bissetti on Drums, and Mick \"Sten Gun\" Wallace on vocals. In the summer of 1977 they started renting a practice room at Brendan Mullen's Masque, and played at the very first parties and shows at the Masque. This line up, in fact, existed just as long as the second line up with Billy Bones, if not longer. In October 1977, the original Skulls line up split, with the musicians going on to form Death By Death with Margaret Guzman on vocals. Sten Gun decided to continue under the name the Skulls and recruited his friend Billy Bones to sing. The band's second line up consisted of Billy Bones on vocals and Marc Moreland on guitar, with bass duties being held by Bruce Moreland or Chas T. Gray and drums by Mick \"Sten Gun\" Wallace. This line up became the most recognizable due to their inclusion on the What? Records ep in 1978 and the Live From The Masque cd in 1996.

      "The Standells band name was created by Larry Tamblyn and Tony Valentino,  derived from standing around booking agents' offices trying to get work.  In early 1962, drummer Benny King joined the group, and as \"the Standels\", their first major performance was in Honolulu at the Oasis Club. After several months, Rich and King departed. Tamblyn then assumed leadership of the group. He and Valentino re-formed the Standels, adding bass guitarist Gary Lane (September 18, 1938 – November 5, 2014) and drummer Gary Leeds, later known as Gary Walker of The Walker Brothers. Later that year, the band lengthened its name to \"Larry Tamblyn & the Standels\".

In the latter part of the year, the band permanently shortened its name to \"The Standells\".

      "The inception of Strawberry Alarm Clock aside from Thee Sixpence is not well documented, largely because none of the other band's recordings (subsequently lost) were released. However, according to Bunnell, many SAC songs came from the band he had formed previously with Seol, Bartek, Randy Zacuto, Fred Schwartz, and Criss Jay, which performed under the names Waterfyrd Traene (pre-SAC), Public Bubble (during SAC), and Buffington Rhodes (post-SAC). There were two recording sessions with some of these personnel, one with Dave Hassinger at the Recording Factory and one with Bill Lazarus at Sunset Sound. There were probably 10 songs in all that were recorded but Bunnell stated that both masters were stolen. The post-SAC incarnation broke up before any success was realized.\n",

Instead, the band released their second studio album, You Don't Have to Be Blood to Be Family. Not long afterward, Jackson left the band, who, lacking a permanent replacement, recruited Barney's 18 Visions bandmate Ken Floyd to fill-in. Floyd appeared on their self-released 2002 EP Face the Mirror. The same year, Barney told the band he'd like to switch from vocals to guitar, as he would often lose his voice on tour, so Peters took over on vocals.

      "The band was named Wall of Voodoo before their first gig in reference to a comment made by Joe Berardi, a friend of Ridgway's and member of the Fibonaccis. Berardi was listening to some of the Acme Soundtracks music Ridgway and Moreland had created in their studio. When Ridgway jokingly compared the multiple-drum-machine- and Farfisa-organ-laden recordings to Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, Berardi commented it sounded more like a \"wall of voodoo\" and the name stuck.\n",
      "The original War was conceived by record producer Jerry Goldstein (\"My Boyfriend's Back\", \"Hang on Sloopy\", \"I Want Candy\") and singer Eric Burdon (ex-lead singer of the British band the Animals). In 1969, Goldstein saw musicians who would eventually become War playing at the Rag Doll in North Hollywood, backing Deacon Jones, and he was attracted to the band's sound. Jordan claimed that the band's goal was to spread a message of brotherhood and harmony, using instruments and voices to speak out against racism, hunger, gangs, crimes, and turf wars, and promote hope and the spirit of brotherhood. Eric Burdon and War began playing live shows to audiences throughout Southern California before entering into the studio to record their debut album Eric Burdon Declares \"War\". The album's best known track, \"Spill the Wine\", was a hit and launched the band's career.\n",

Four songs off of their EP were remixed and remastered for The Continental Divide. The entire record was written and recorded in Los Angeles, mostly at Regime Studios. William also serves as the band's producer. In the 11 weeks leading up to the release, the band debuted one new song on their Myspace page every Sunday at midnight. The record was released on May 26, 2009. The band then held two CD release parties, one at Club Moscow in Hollywood, CA, and another in Orange County, California.

      "The band finally had a solid line up in place and had adopted the name Warbringer after attempting to combine \"War\" as a prefix to a variety of words. They recorded a four-song demo in 2004 that was never released. It is the only recording with Victor Mikhaltsevich in the band. Due to creative differences the band decided to seek out another guitar player. Emilio Hoschet soon joined the band, and in 2005 they self-financed the Born of the Ruins demo.

      "As was the case with contemporaries Ratt and Rough Cutt, the group's core – guitarists Joe Floyd and Tommy Asakawa, bassist Rick Bennett and vocalist Parramore McCarty – was made up of San Diego, California transplants in search of fame and fortune. Prior to Warrior, McCarty had fronted the band Phenomenon, active during 1977–78, which also featured future Ratt guitarist Robbin Crosby and posthumously issued \"The Final Word\" b/w \"Ain't No Doubt About It\" 7\" single in 1980. By 1979, Phenomenon had morphed into Secret Service and McCarty and Crosby were joined by guitarist Tommy Asakawa. When McCarty and Asakawa exited, Secred Service became Aircraft, now fronted by future Riverdogs vocalist Rob Lamothe, re-named Mac Meda in 1981. McCarty and Asakawa would soon join forces with Floyd and Bennett. Adding drummer Liam Jason to the line-up after making the move to Los Angeles and initially going under the name Fury, the band soon started to make a name for themselves in the local clubs with their futuristic brand of European influenced heavy metal.\n",

Young the Giant spent 2010 opening for Minus the Bear and Steel Train while working its debut album with Joe Chiccarelli at Sunset Sound Studios in Los Angeles. They took an old-school approach to recording the album. All the tracks were performed live which resulted in a lot of “chopping” during production. The band was very vigilant of their tracks but trusted the decisions of Joe Chiccarelli who had previously produced albums for The Shins, The Strokes, and Saints of Valory. The band believed in transparency; they only wanted to record what they could reproduce in front of an audience at a live show.\n",

      "The Stern family, consisting of older brothers Shawn (guitar and vocals) and Mark (drums) and younger brother Adam (who would later play bass), moved from Toronto, Canada to Los Angeles in 1970, because their father worked in the film industry.  As teenagers, Shawn and Mark were surfers who would skip school to smoke marijuana and attend rock concerts. At 16 and 17, they played in their first band, called Mess, which would play Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix covers at parties. A year later in 1978, they discovered punk rock, and formed a quirky prog/New Wave band called The Extremes, releasing a four-song EP in which Shawn would sing with a fake English accent.\n",
      "In 1978, Penalosa left the band briefly to live and play in Los Angeles, and was replaced by Guy Lopez, Robert Lopez's brother. Soon after, Robert left to live in Los Angeles as well, and his brother quit the Zeros. Penalosa rejoined the band and they continued as a trio, and eventually relocated to San Francisco. In March 1979, UK music magazine NME reported that \"punk riots had come to the U.S., when Los Angeles police broke up a Zeros' gig at Elks Hall.\" In 1980, the band recorded a new single, including the songs \"They Say That (Everything's Alright),\" \"Girl on the Block\" and \"Getting Nowhere Fast.\" After more touring that led to Austin, Texas and New York, the band fizzled out.\n",

The Burial are described in Burning Britain: The History of UK Punk 1980–1984 as \"Skinhead Ska\".

The three-song EP sold all 2,000 copies and brought the band to the attention of the UK music press. Melody Maker journalist Carol Clerk befriended the band and recommended them to John Curd, manager of WXYZ Records, who signed them to his label. Gary Smith replaced Fenton on bass, and the Defects moved to London in 1982 and embarked on the six-week \"So What\" UK tour with labelmates the Anti-Nowhere League, Chelsea and Chron Gen.

Allmusic praised the album for its \"melodic appeal\" and the band’s \"ability to make entirely political lyrics work in a personal, intelligent manner\", while the group’s sound was compared to Gang of Four.\n",
      "They released their debut album, Flowers for all Occasions, on Kasper Records in 1985. It received a five-star review from Sounds, with Roger Holland describing it as a \"positively heroic album\".\n",

      "Although they performed at the Windsor Free Festival in 1974, publicity material at the time stated that they did not own any musical instruments, refused to tour, and said that they were not a \"real\" band and had no future in the music industry.  Despite this, they were signed to Virgin Records in a one-off deal, and released \"Do The Standing Still (Classics Illustrated)\", first recorded as a demo in 1975.  The single was an NME 'Single Of The Week', rapidly becoming a cult favourite.  The lyrics were a collection of lines from comic books, and \"people used to rush the dance floor and stand still for the duration of the song when it came on in clubs.\"\n",
      "They toured Europe twice before they eventually split in 1986.  Roy Wallace released Belfast in 1987, performing with Deno and Gary from DIRT to re-record old Toxic Waste tracks (as well as previously unreleased tracks).  Marty and Roy used their experience from their time in Toxic Waste to form Bleeding Rectum.  The band was revived briefly in 1991 for a benefit tour, with Deno from DIRT on vocals.\n",
      "Despite only releasing two singles and being active for less than three years, the band developed a lasting cult following. BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel placed their first single \"Sick of You\" in his chosen Festive Fifty chart of 1977, and after his death it was revealed that he'd kept it as part of his favourite singles of all time.  The single was later reissued in 1999 and 2006 by Damaged Goods.\n",

      "Knorkator announced the end of the band in a MySpace bulletin on June 14, 2008, the last concert was played on December 5 that year in Berlin. The official reason given for the band's breakup was that Alf Ator wanted to leave Germany to start a new life in Thailand. In autumn 2010 a bulletin by Stumpen announced the bands' reunion. A first \"small\" tour followed in April 2011 as well as some concerts at well-known festivals like Wacken Open Air. The tour was called the \"77 minutes tour\", as the setlist was planned to be exactly 77 minutes long. A digital clock that counted down the minutes was placed on stage to make sure the time limit was not exceeded. Their new album \"Es werde Nicht\" (translates to \"Let there be Not\" or \"Let Not Be\", a pun on \"Es werde Licht\" - \"Let there be Light\") has been released in September 2011, followed by a big tour with concerts of regular length. \n",

He left in 2000 and Gordon Mocznay took over on guitar and bass guitar. A year later in 2001, Louis Manke joined the band as well, adding a second guitar to the band. Despite being involved with numerous bands, all members are still creating music with Terminal Choice and an album entitled \"New Born Enemies\" was released in 2006. They have released a video for \"Don't Go\".\n",
      "In 1999, the rest of the band separated from Josef Maria Klumb, who was accused of entertaining right extremist ideas. The lyrics composition, previously handled entirely by Klumb, was taken over by the new vocalist Tom von K., who could however still use old text fragments for inspiration.\n",
      "Das Album (The Album) was released the following year with Eiszeit im Paradies becoming somewhat of a local club favourite. Due to a conflict of interests the original lineup disbanded before the official release of Das Album. Winter quickly recruited two new \nmembers to complete the line up, Jürgen Zass (bass, backing vocals) and Olaf Ginko (drums).

      "In 2006, APTBS gained acclaim following their Webster Hall performance with the Brian Jonestown Massacre. The band returned to Webster Hall in 2007 to play with one of their major influences, the Jesus and Mary Chain. Throughout these formative years, the band's live shows became increasingly chaotic, which earned them the title of New York City's \"loudest band\" from various indie reviewers and bloggers, as well as \"the most ear-shatteringly loud garage/shoegaze band you'll ever hear\" by The Washington Post. The New York Times applauded their revival of \"the ominous, feedback-drenched drones of the 1980s\".\n",
      "In August 1990, the band's debut single, a cover version of \"My Boyfriend's Back\", preceded third album Mule, released the following month, and described by Trouser Press as \"challenging and invigorating\".

Shortly thereafter, Michael Lerner and Darby Cicci came on board transforming The Antlers into a collaborative group.\n",
      "Anthrax was formed in Queens, New York City, on July 18, 1981, by guitarists Scott Ian and Dan Lilker. The band was named after the disease of the same name which Ian saw in a biology textbook, chosen because it sounded \"sufficiently evil\". Lilker originally intended for Scott Setari to play bass in the band, during their early phases as a cover band. Anthrax's initial line-up was completed by singer John Connelly, drummer Dave Weiss and bassist Paul Kahn. Kahn was briefly replaced by bassist Kenny Kushner before Lilker took over on bass and Greg Walls joined as lead guitarist. Weiss was then replaced early on by Greg D'Angelo, who was recommended to the band by Greg Walls. Scott Ian's younger brother Jason Rosenfeld was a temporary vocalist until Ian's former schoolmate Neil Turbin joined the band in late August 1982. The band recorded its first demo tape during this time.\n",
      "Between 2005 and 2006, the quintet played around New York City opening for such diverse acts as Akron/Family, Genghis Tron, and Mouth of the Architect. College Music Journal commented on Bloody Panda's live performances stating, \"Known for their daring stage shows, the band performs in executioner's hoods and robes to amplify their Yoko Ono-meets-Black Sabbath (or Sunn O)))-like) riff work.\" The band released—through Holy Roar—a split album with avant-garde metal group Kayo Dot in early 2007, and also recorded a cover of Eyehategod's \"Anxiety Hangover\" for the tribute album For the Sick.

In 2013, the Candles were recruited as the back up band by Alberta Cross for shows in the United States and Europe where they also served as the opening act. Shortly thereafter they joined Cory Chisel and The Wandering Sons for several tours as their backup band in addition to appearing as the opening act.\n",

      "Pudignano left the band, and was replaced by Mike Pedulla. The band gigged around New York throughout 1980 playing at various clubs. In late 1980, Pedulla announced that he was leaving the band, and Jonathan Kane took his place. Shortly after, the band landed a recording contract with the newly formed Labor Records. The band recorded demos of two songs, \"Children Remember\" and \"Yellow Light\" at Sorcerer Sound to prepare for a forthcoming EP. Producer Peter Ivers oversaw the recording of further tracks at Minot Sound in White Plains, New York.\n",

      "Their penultimate performance was at Giorgio Gomelsky's N.Y.C. loft. It was there that Thurston Moore met Kim Gordon.\n",
      "The band's early years were spent living in burnt out buildings, squats, and on the streets. By 1982-1983, Flanagan had recorded the very first Cro-Mags demo consisting of four songs that would become the blueprint for their debut album, The Age of Quarrel (1986). Flanagan wrote all of the music, played each instrument, and performed vocals. Before long, he connected with Parris Mayhew and the two started writing music and auditioning band members. Singer John Joseph parted ways with the band for the first time after Age of Quarrel, leaving bass player Harley Flanagan to sing on the following Cro-Mags release, Best Wishes (1989), which had a more heavy metal-influenced sound. The next record Alpha Omega saw the return of Joseph singing along with Flanagan. According to guitarist and songwriter Parris Mayhew, he wrote most of the album with guitarist Rob Buckley. However, neither Mayhew or Buckley played on the actual recording, and the writing has been disputed by Flanagan and others. Cro-Mags disbanded but later recorded the album with the return of Doug Holland and a new rhythm guitarist: Gabby Abularach.\n",
      "The band’s follow-up recording Hi-Tech Lowlife was released in 2005 again to positive reviews.  Popmatters described the record as “subtle power pop at its most pleasant,” while AllMusic critic Jason Damas cited the band as “ some of the most lyrically and musically rich modern guitar-pop.”\n",
      "In 2012, Saks moved to Mexico City, where he recorded DeLeon's third LP, Tremor Fantasma.  They released album independently because their former label JDub Records had dissolved.

      "Frustrated by the lack of sales, the band broke up for a few months in late 1975, but reconvened in early 1976, with bassist Mark \"The Animal\" Mendoza replacing Shernoff and Ritchie Teeter replacing King. After a few months Shernoff was persuaded to return to the group as the group's keyboardist. This line-up soon secured a contract with Asylum Records (at least partly due to the notoriety the group had developed following a well-publicized brawl between Manitoba and Wayne County) and released their second album, Manifest Destiny, in 1977. The album was produced by Pearlman and Krugman with songs written by Shernoff.\n",
      "In 2016, the band released its second studio album, Is the Is Are, after a lengthy and troubled gestation period. On October 4, 2019, DIIV's third album, Deceiver, was released on Captured Tracks.\n",
      "The band signed with a Frenchkiss Records, and began to record their first studio album in May 2013. The album was produced by Gus Oberg and Johnny T, while recording took place over a three-week period. It received mixed reviews.\n",
      "In 2008, Pierce and Graham came up with the concept for The Drums, and Pierce moved to Kissimmee, Florida, where Graham resided at the time, so that they could more readily collaborate. They then moved to Brooklyn, in the spring of 2009, where drummer Connor Hanwick and former Elkland guitarist Adam Kessler joined the band to complete their live sound. The band had their first gig within a week of arriving in Brooklyn at Cake Shop NYC as part of the NYC Pop Fest. In October 2009, the band released their first EP, Summertime!.\n",
      "The band caught the ear of producer Bryan Russell, who recorded a five-song, self-titled EP with Envy on the Coast, which was officially released on September 19, 2006, on Photo Finish Records.\n",
      "Rabid recruited vocalist Korbet, bassist Keil and guitarist Weeks. This 1981-82 lineup of Even Worse performed at prominent New York City punk concerts and made their recorded debut with two songs on New York Thrash, a legendary document of the early '80s New York City punk and hardcore scene issued only on cassette by ROIR. The tape also featured their contemporaries the Stimulators, Bad Brains, the Undead, Heart Attack and Kraut. Even Worse also recorded an entire studio album in November 1981, which went unreleased until 2002. This most well-known version of the band broke up in early 1982, leaving Rabid to put together another totally different lineup including Tempkin, Waxman, journalist/DJ Sommer and Moore (the latter played guitar in the band during 1982-1983 while concurrently in Sonic Youth).\n",
      "That August, Kelleher switched to guitar and the band placed a classified ad for a bass player in the Irish Voice newspaper. Patrick Clifford (from New York City) answered the ad, was hired, and completed the Kelleher-Yeates-Clifford nucleus that would hold for the remainder of the band's existence.\n",
      "The band began to gain traction in October 2009 as they honed their sound on subway platforms around New York City. Toward the latter part of 2009, they self-released Weathervanes, and on April 27, 2010 the album was re-released under the band's record labels, Frenchkiss and Mom + Pop. To promote their record, the band toured regularly from early 2010 thorough Spring 2011.\n",
      "On October 19, 2004, Full Blown Chaos released Wake the Demons and have since toured with such acts as Hatebreed, Terror, Sick of It All, Madball, Himsa, Napalm Death and many others. Wake the Demons was described as \"songs of inner-strength, backed with riffage that hug hairpin turns and a dynamite-triggering rhythm section.\"\n",
      "Come Find Yourself, the band's first album, was released in the summer of 1996 by Chrysalis Records and followed their single \"The Grave And The Constant\" (UK No. 72), which was released a month earlier, into the UK charts. The album also featured the UK Top 40 hits, \"Scooby Snacks\" (UK No. 22), \"The Fun Lovin' Criminal\" (UK No. 26) and \"King Of New York\" (UK No. 28). The subject of latter touched on the imprisonment of Italian-American mafioso John Gotti, the wannabe gangsters emulating his style, and his fans and followers in his community that maintained his innocence. The biggest hit, \"Scooby Snacks\", features samples from films by Quentin Tarantino and a guitar sample from Tones On Tail song \"Movement of Fear\", interspersed with rap verses and a sung, anthemic, chorus. Come Find Yourself had a slow rise up the UK Albums Chart, finally peaking at No. 7 and spending well over a year in the chart, however it failed to make any impact in the US. The success of the album prompted the re-release of \"Scooby Snacks\" as a single, alongside a cover of the 10cc classic \"I'm Not In Love\", which this time reached UK No. 12.\n",
      "Both Lennon and Muhl are multi-instrumentalists. Among the instruments the band uses, are the guitar, drums, and also the bayan. Muhl, also a successful model, has been featured in Maybelline campaigns, as well as  Jennifer Lopez's clothing brand J Lo. She uses funds from her modeling work to fund her musical endeavours.\n",
      "In 1999, the band entered the studio at Indigo Ranch in Malibu, California, with producer Ross Robinson (At the Drive-In, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, among others) to record their first full-length album titled Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence, which saw release in 2000 through Roadrunner Records. On being signed, guitarist Justin Beck said: \"Ross showed up at a practice, we start a song; 5-4-3-2-1. Ross stands up, waving his hands and he's like, 'It's over, it's done. I want to do this, you've got a deal!' The line-up on this record was Palumbo, Beck, Todd Weinstock, Manuel Carrero & Sammy Siegler (who left the band prior to the subsequent tour). Robinson has said of it: \"Our goal at the time of that record was to destroy Adidas rock\", a self-deprecating reference to the Adidas-sponsored bands (Korn, Limp Bizkit) Robinson had produced and championed as part of the nu-metal movement. The music was aggressive and unrelenting, but also included spacious songs like \"When One Eight Becomes Two Zeros\", \"Her Middle Name is Boom\", \"Piano\" and the epic \"Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence\", the latter of which deals with Palumbo's problems with Crohn's disease. The music, accompanied with Palumbo's lyrics—which were often bitter and resentful towards particular characters he was discussing—and his singing style in itself—powerful and aggressive guttural screaming along with a melodic touch—created a unique dynamic. Although Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence is often cited as a milestone post-hardcore album, it saw little push from Roadrunner, causing the band to garner an ill-will towards the label. Matters were somewhat worsened when Palumbo started to have bouts with his Crohn's disease on tour, as his aggressive performance style sometimes triggers a relapse, which has the potential to be fatal. It is alleged that Roadrunner would not allow Palumbo to leave the tour to rest.\n",
      "In 2004, Droste released Grizzly Bear's debut album, Horn of Plenty. Predominately a solo album, the album featured contributions from future drummer Christopher Bear. Rolling Stone magazine wrote of the first album, \"the pure atmospheric power of the songs is more than enough to hypnotize.\"\n",

      "The band quickly became one of the most popular and well-known underground bands in New York City, headlining shows at CBGB, Mother's (located across from the Chelsea Hotel), and Max's Kansas City. In the band's early days, each member took turns on vocals, with Hell bringing in songs (such as \"Blank Generation\") originally written for Television, and Thunders contributing new material as well. Lure began singing lead on some songs and co-writing with Nolan. The combination of the style-conscious Nolan and Thunders with the beatnik Hell and gangly Lure made for a visually arresting and musically powerful group. As Blondie's Clem Burke said, \"You could call them the punk rock Beatles. Each person really stood out.\" Although popular, the early lineup could not get a recording contract, in no small part due to the band's well-known heroin use - as vividly described in their best-known song, \"Chinese Rocks\" (which was actually written by Dee Dee Ramone with contributions from Hell). Live recordings of the Thunders/Hell/Nolan/Lure lineup were eventually released on the LP Live at Mother's, and studio demos were released in 2019.\n",
      "The group was the first rock band to play the club CBGB, which soon became a breeding ground for the early punk rock scene in New York. Hell had an energetic stage presence and wore torn clothing held together with safety pins and his hair spiked, which was to be influential in punk fashion - in 1975, after a failed management deal with the New York Dolls, impresario Malcolm McLaren claimed to have brought these ideas back with him to England and eventually incorporated them into the Sex Pistols' image, a claim which Sex Pistols' front man John Lydon/Johnny Rotten disputes, citing his own existing use of safety pins and spiked hair (dyed green) prior to joining the Pistols.\n",
      "Nicolay re-joined the band on May 4, 2016, and the band has since embarked on several concert residencies in the US and the UK. To coincide with each new event, The Hold Steady releases stand-alone singles, marking the first recorded material of the six-piece line-up. The band's seventh LP, Thrashing Thru the Passion, was released in August 2019.\n",
      "The band first gained attention with a music video featuring a cover of \"White Rabbit\" by Jefferson Airplane, soon followed by a video for their own song. The band's first video from their debut album, Her Screwed Up Head, \"25 Steps,\" was directed by  Noah Hutton.  Following this, the band released three more videos:  \"Soybean\" (also from the album), \"Lucky Ones\" (a new track, produced by Julian Raymond and Tim Sommer), and a new version of the song \"Her Screwed Up Head,\" also produced by Raymond and Sommer.  \n",
      "In 1983, Kiss began performing without makeup and costumes, thus marking the beginning of the band's \"unmasked\" era that would last for over a decade. The band experienced a commercial resurgence during this era, with the Platinum-certified album Lick It Up successfully introducing them to a new generation of fans, and its music videos received regular airplay on MTV. Eric Carr, who had replaced Criss in 1980, died in 1991 of heart cancer and was replaced by Eric Singer. In response to a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the mid-1990s, the original lineup re-united in 1996, which also saw the return of its makeup and stage costumes. The resulting Alive/Worldwide Tour was highly successful, grossing $143.7 million, making it the band's most successful tour to date. Criss and Frehley subsequently left the band again, and have been replaced by Singer and Tommy Thayer. The band has continued with its original stage makeup, with Singer and Thayer using the original Catman and Spaceman makeup, respectively. In September 2018, Kiss announced that, after 45 years of recording and performing, it would be embarking on its ongoing final tour, the End of the Road World Tour, which started in January 2019 and is currently set to conclude in 2022.\n",
      "Now a complete band, Leftöver Crack proceeded to record several songs with the full line-up, including songs such as \"Rock The 40 Oz.\", \"Crack City Rockers\" and \"The Good, The Bad And The Leftover Crack\" - effectively the band's 'theme song'. Five of these songs were later included on the band's first release - the \"Rock the 40 Oz.\" 7\" EP, which was released by Bankshot! Records on March 8, 2000.\n",
      "To promote the release of full Isaac, Lotion toured America and Europe with Pavement, Throwing Muses, and Mercury Rev.  In 1995, the band released a self-titled EP on Big Cat Records, with a second EP, The Agnew Funeral E.P., recorded the next year. In 1996, Lotion released their second album, Nobody's Cool, with liner notes by Thomas Pynchon.\n",
      "Midtown's next album, Forget What You Know (2004), was produced while the band was not under contract with a record label and was later picked up by Columbia Records. This was the band's final studio album; they disbanded shortly after its release in 2005. Former frontman Gabe Saporta then became the lead singer of the now-defunct alternative dance/synthpop band Cobra Starship, which disbanded in November 2015. Former guitarist Heath Saraceno joined the band Senses Fail in 2005 but decided to leave them in 2009 to pursue personal endeavors. Tyler Rann went on to sing for Band of Thieves with some friends but eventually left the music business and now works in the fashion/clothing industry.\n",

      "The day after playing the Canal Room, the band was signed to Photo Finish Records. The band would spend the better part of that year touring and working on their first EP. The group began touring with Half Moon Run in October 2013 that ended with a performance at the 2013 CMJ Music Marathon. This would be shortly followed by a six-week tour with American Authors and The Royal Concept. All the while, the group had been preparing songs for their debut EP, Reflections.\n",
      "In 1984 Mod Fun released their first single, \"I Am With You\" b/w \"Happy Feeling\" on their own label, New Records.  Playing frequently at such New York City clubs as CBGB, The Dive and R.T. Firefly, they signed a record deal with NYC's Midnight Records.  They released their first album, 90 Wardour Street in 1985.  Their live shows were high energy (sometimes reckless) spectacles, which have been said to have influenced many people who saw them to start bands of their own.\n",
      "Information about the Neon Boys includes oral histories, newspaper and magazine articles, and narratives written by the band members themselves. As such, there may be some discrepancies in issues like band formation dates and songs recorded. For example, according to The A to Z of Alternative Music, only two songs were recorded by the Neon Boys. This is contradicted by Genius that lists four songs. The fact that the band never performed a live show adds to the confusion.\n",
      "After the release of Anthrax's debut album Fistful of Metal, bassist Dan Lilker, a founding member of the group, was fired by the band. He decided to pursue a more aggressive style of music and formed Nuclear Assault with guitarist/vocalist John Connelly, who had been involved in an early version of Anthrax. They were joined by guitarist Mike Bogush and drummer Scott Duboys (later of Cities, Cycle Sluts From Hell and Warrior Soul). They then recorded the first of two demos, which included the songs \"Stranded in Hell\", \"The Plague\", and \"Hang the Pope\".\n",
      "In late 2007, The Pains started a MySpace page to showcase their songs. Berman noted that at the time, the band name was all the group had. The name comes from the title of an unpublished children's story by Charles Augustus Steen III (a friend of Berman's), which revolves around \"realising what matters most in life – things like friendship and having a good time\". The trio began working on numerous tracks. Songs such as \"Contender\", \"Come Saturday\", and \"This Love Is Fucking Right!\" would stay band favorites, winding up on the 2009 album The Pains of Being Pure at Heart. Other tracks, such as \"Orchard of My Eye\", would be released on their first EP. It was at the time of their MySpace uploads that attention was being drawn to the act. Prominent music websites, such as Pitchfork and Stereogum, kept tabs on The Pains of Being Pure at Heart.\n",
      "On their second tour, in October 2010, they once again attracted TV headlines with record-breaking crowds during the closing of the Shanghai World Expo. They also made history as the final guests on EXPO 360, a show highlighting the best of the World Expo. Making headlines in the fashion world, lead singer Teresa Lee wore a dress by Flora Zeta.

The three decided to end their commitments to their old bands, move into a shared space and create a home recording studio together.\n",
      "The band soon after began a longtime association with Blackout Records, who released some of their songs on the label's compilation Where the Wild Things Are, in 1989, along with a 7 inch Live At CBGB release. The following year, the band recorded their debut full length Just Can't Hate Enough. The record was engineered by Tommy Victor of Prong. As Victor also worked at CBGB, he was able to allow the band to record live at the famous bar in the morning and afternoon hours before shows were held. The record was released in Germany on Starving Missile Records, and later released stateside under the Blackout name. Just Can't Hate Enough quickly became one of the records that defined the new, heavier sound of hardcore that was emerging at the time, played by bands such as Biohazard and Killing Time, among others. The guitar tone and riffs, in particular, display a large heavy metal influence, especially from Swiss speed metallers Celtic Frost, who were allegedly one of Alan Blake's favorite bands. The band also became known for Bearer's no-nonsense stage personality, with some finding him offensive, and others enjoying his often blunt and obscenity filled humor.\n",
      "Following that tour, guitarist Ian Brannigan (who was also Solomon's boyfriend at the time) left the band and was replaced by Fureigh. The new lineup made its debut at JDub Records' annual \"Jewltide\" Christmas Eve party at Southpaw in Brooklyn, NY (a venue the band spoke of as their home base until its closure in 2011). In May 2010, the Shondes released their second album My Dear One on Fanatic Records, which has been referred to as their \"break-up album,\" in the aftermath of Brannigan's departure.They toured nationally to support it that year, beginning at South By Southwest in March throughout the Spring, receiving favorable critical response along the way, again particularly for the emotive quality of their live performance.\n",
      "After recruiting a new bass guitar player, Paul \"Freak Love\", and thanks to frequent touring, the band was signed by Roadrunner Records. In June 1997, they released their first Roadrunner Records album, Hipnosis. Shootyz Groove then moved to Reprise Records and resurfaced two years later with High Definition and gained popularity with single \"L Train\". Shootyz Groove broke up after this album, some of the members starting a band called Dead Fly Syndrome. In 2004, Shootyz Groove reappeared. They have released a demo of \"Heard That All Before\" taken from their forthcoming, untitled album on their website. In early versions of iTunes, \"L Train\" was bundled. Some of their tracks, including \"Blow Your Top\" and \"Mad For It\", were included in the PlayStation game, Street Skater 2. \"Mad For It\" was also featured in the game Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder. Eventually, they signed to a Japanese label.\n",
      "Salas-Humara quit the band following the release of The Silos, and purchased the rights to The Silos name from Rupe in 1991, thus dissolving the partnership.  Subsequent albums included Hasta La Victoria (1992), Susan Across The Ocean (1994), Heater and its remix companion Cooler (both 1998).  After Heater was recorded, Salas-Humara turned the band into a three piece with Drew Glackin on bass and lap steel guitar and Konrad Meissner on drum and backing vocals. The subsequent records were Laser Beam Next Door (2001), When The Telephone Rings (2004), and the live This Highway Is A Circle followed.

The album was recorded by John Hill in the API room at Greenwich Village's Electric Lady Studios.\n",

      "Their trademark was the slideshow itself: slides collected from \"estate sales, garage sales, thrift stores, etc.\" were constantly shown in order to \"turn the lives of annonymous   strangers into pop-rock musical exposs based on the contents of these slide collections\".

      "In 2007, Vampire Weekend's song \"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\" was ranked 67th on Rolling Stone's list of the \"100 Best Songs of the Year\". In November 2007, they toured the UK with The Shins.\nThe then-nascent influence of blog hype and internet buzz played a role in their success and led to a large prerelease following sufficient to support them performing on three tours before their debut album was released. They were declared \"The Year's Best New Band\" by Spin magazine in the March 2008 issue, and were the first band to be shot for the cover of the magazine before releasing their debut album. The band made a television appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman on February 1, 2008, and on March 8, 2008, performed on Saturday Night Live. Four songs from the band's first album also made the Triple J Hottest 100, 2008. The internet hype had its backlash, however, as critics reacted against a perceived image of Vampire Weekend as privileged, upper-class Ivy League graduates stealing from foreign musicians. One critic went so far as to call Vampire Weekend the \"whitest band in the world,\" to which they took exception, given their Ukrainian, Persian, Italian, and Hungarian heritages. Koenig responded in a November 2009 interview by saying, \"Nobody in our band is a WASP.\" Furthermore, the backlash involving their social backgrounds was largely unfounded, as Koenig explained in the interview that the band members got into Columbia on scholarship and used student loans; he himself was still paying off student loans in 2009.\n",
      "The group was the first rock band to play the club CBGB, which soon became a breeding ground for the early punk rock scene in New York. Hell had an energetic stage presence and wore torn clothing held together with safety pins and his hair spiked, which was to be influential in punk fashion - in 1975, after a failed management deal with the New York Dolls, impresario Malcolm McLaren claimed to have brought these ideas back with him to England and eventually incorporated them into the Sex Pistols' image, a claim which Sex Pistols' front man John Lydon/Johnny Rotten disputes, citing his own existing use of safety pins and spiked hair (dyed green) prior to joining the Pistols.\n",

      "The band's debut 7\" EP, \"Too Many Creeps\", was released in 1980 on 99 Records. It reached No. 57 on the Billboard club play chart. The follow-up, \"Things That Go Boom in the Night\", was issued in 1981 by Fetish Records, hitting No. 43 on the UK Indie Chart. The Rituals 12\" EP, produced by Topper Headon of the Clash and including the popular \"Can't Be Funky\", was released in 1981 by Fetish in the UK and by Stiff Records in the U.S. It reached No. 32 on the Billboard club chart.\n",
      "Former members of Renato Russo's pioneering post-punk band Aborto Elétrico teamed up to form the Capital Inicial, continuing to perform the same type of music. Brothers Felipe Lemos (drums) and Flávio Lemos (bass) joined guitarist Loro Jones (former Blitz 64) and vocalist Dinho Ouro Preto. All of them are based in Brasília, a city that, with its particular situation as Brazil's capital, revolves around politicians who abandon it on the weekends. The city's coldness was a choice culture for the fermentation of the aggressiveness of dispossessed youngsters, creating an ideal situation for the arousal of punk bands. With similar songs as Aborto Elétrico's repertoire, the Capital Inicial followed in their path. The first time that Capital (and their sister band, Legião Urbana, also erected upon the ashes of Aborto Elétrico) played in Rio was on July 23, 1983, opening a Lobão show at the Circo Voador. In 1984, they released their first single, \"Descendo o Rio Nilo\" (Going Down the Nile) and \"Leve Desespero\" (Slight Despair) (Epic), with good repercussions. The latter song was included in the film Areias Escaldantes. In April 1985, Capital Inicial succeeded in having their Descendo o Rio Nilo included on the compilation Os Intocáveis (CBS). In the next year, the group recorded their first LP, Capital Inicial (Polygram), which had the hits \"Psicopata\" (Psychopath), \"Música Urbana\" (Urban Music) and \"Fátima\" selling 200,000 copies. This was followed by a period of many live shows.\n",
      "Pudignano left the band, and was replaced by Mike Pedulla. The band gigged around New York throughout 1980 playing at various clubs. In late 1980, Pedulla announced that he was leaving the band, and Jonathan Kane took his place. Shortly after, the band landed a recording contract with the newly formed Labor Records. The band recorded demos of two songs, \"Children Remember\" and \"Yellow Light\" at Sorcerer Sound to prepare for a forthcoming EP. Producer Peter Ivers oversaw the recording of further tracks at Minot Sound in White Plains, New York.\n",
      "By early 1980, DA! had replaced Marquis with the guitarist David Thomas (who had previously played in St. Louis punk bands, The Singapores and Cool Jerk). By that summer, the band had become a fixture on Chicago's early punk music scene, performing regularly at area clubs like Exit, Oz, O'Banion's, Tuts, Waves and Space Place and opening for visiting groups including the Fall, DNA, Bauhaus and Mission of Burma.\n",
      "\"At that time everyone in New York had a band,\" Jarmusch recalled in an interview for The Washington Post (1984). \"The idea was that you didn't have to be a virtuoso musician to have a band. The spirit was more important than having technical expertise, and that influenced a lot of filmmakers.\" According to Sante, they were \"a band that insouciantly blended high and low, virtuosity and amateurism, calypso and science fiction, pots and pans and drones and the Supremes. They released several records, on a British label, which did very well in the former Yugoslavia.\"\n",
      "The members of Delta 5 were also important figures in the Rock Against Racism movement, and were the subject of a highly publicized assault at the hands of a right-wing group affiliated with rival movement Rock Against Communism.\n",
      "Tony Wilson from Factory Records approached the band after a performance at Hurrah in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and three days later they began recording with Martin Hannett in Manchester, England. They recorded \"Moody\" and \"You're No Good\" in the first take. Hannett had three minutes left on the master tape, so he had the band record \"UFO\". The recordings helped bring Bahlman's focus to the band. On December 3, 1980, he recorded ESG's performance at Hurrah, which became the B-side for ESG. Bahlman formed a partnership with Factory so that his 99 Records label could release the EP in 1981. By July, they made a second pressing of the record. It was received positively by music critics. Robert Palmer called it one of 1981's \"freshest records\". The New York Times placed ESG second on its list of the best EPs and cassettes of 1981, and The Village Voice placed the EP third on its Pazz & Jop critics' poll.\n",
      "In 1978–1981 Logic also performed as a member of Red Crayola, as well as playing on recordings by The Stranglers, The Raincoats and Swell Maps.\n",
      "The genesis of Faith No More was the group Sharp Young Men, formed in 1979 by vocalist Mike Morris and keyboardist Wade Worthington. Drummer Mike Bordin and bassist Billy Gould joined afterwards. Mike Morris described the name as \"a piss-take on all the ‘elegant’ groups at the time\". Later on, Morris proposed the name Faith In No Man, but, eventually, the band settled on Bordin's suggestion Faith No Man (stylized as Faith. No Man).\nThe band recorded \"Quiet in Heaven/Song of Liberty\", released in 1983. The songs were recorded in Matt Wallace's parents' garage, where Wallace had set up and been running a recording studio while the band was still recording under the name Sharp Young Men, with Mike Morris, Billy Gould, Mike Bordin and Wade Worthington. Worthington left shortly thereafter. They changed their name to Faith No Man for the release of the single, which featured two of the three songs recorded in Wallace's garage, and hired Roddy Bottum to replace Worthington. Bottum, Gould and Bordin quit the band shortly after and formed Faith No More. They chose the name to accentuate the fact that \"The Man\" (Mike Morris) was \"No More\". The band played with several vocalists and guitarists, including a brief stint with Courtney Love, until they settled on vocalist Chuck Mosley in 1983 and later, guitarist Jim Martin.\n",
      "The Feelies rarely worked with outside producers, although Peter Buck of R.E.M. co-produced their second album The Good Earth, one of their most successful albums. They frequently played at Maxwell's, a live music venue and bar/restaurant in Hoboken, during the 1980s.\n",
      "Flipper's first recordings appeared in late 1979 on the SF Underground 7\" EP released on the newly formed Subterranean Records, followed by the \"Love Canal\"/\"Ha Ha Ha\" 7\" single in 1980.\n",
      "Featuring members of underground Lincoln bands Cartoon Pupils and Hymn to Joy, the band first called itself Glue, and then D.B.L., finally settling on Four Against One, a name that reflected its status as a quintet at the time. Bassist Liz Panarelli's early departure gave way to keyboardist Jeffrey Runnings' shift to bass, as well as the band's truncation of its name to For Against. By 1985, singer Jon Fynbu had departed as well, leaving the core trio of guitarist Harry Dingman III, drummer Gregory Hill and bassist Jeffrey Runnings. The latter would become (with very few exceptions) the band's sole vocalist and lyricist.\n",
      "After the respective bands broke up in the mid-1990s, Mould and Hart continued doing solo work, the latter until his death in 2017. Norton was initially less active musically after Hüsker Dü and focused on being a restaurateur instead. He returned to the recording industry in 2006.\n",
      "I'm So Hollow played their first gig opening for Clock DVA in Sheffield's Penthouse Club. Their highest profile gig was at the Leeds Futurama Festival on the 13th September 1980. They performed the song \"Touch\" in Eve Wood's documentary film Made in Sheffield (2001).\n",
      "In Camera released a 7\" single, \"Die Laughing\"/\"Final Achievement\" in 1979, followed six months later by the four-track EP IV Songs. Various gigs materialised throughout England, culminating at the end of 1980 in a John Peel session. This resulted in the release of the session on 12\" as the EP Fin; the recording being the final vinyl document of the band before its non-acrimonious split in 1981.\n",
      "Despite releasing a split single with leading alt-rockers Nirvana and signing to Capitol Records, the band failed to find commercial success amid the alternative rock explosion of the 1990s and disbanded in 1999. Their reunion tour ten years later garnered positive responses from audiences and critics. The Jesus Lizard performed another reunion tour in 2017 and 2019.\n",
      "Under the name Kleenex, the band formed in Zürich in 1978, with an initial line-up that included Lislot Ha (Lieselotte Hafner) on drums, Klaudia Schiff (Klaudia Schifferle) on bass and vocals, and Regula Sing on lead vocals. Marlene Marder (Marlene Marti), an acquaintance of the band, filled in on guitar during the encore portion of their first live performance, and thereafter remained in the band as their full-time guitarist.\n",
      "Since its live debut at The Factory, Ludus was favourably reviewed in the press. In January 1979, Paul Morley, writing for NME, remarked: \n",
      "Meat Puppets have influenced a number of rock bands, including Nirvana, Soundgarden, Dinosaur Jr, Sebadoh, Pavement, and Jawbreaker.\n",
      "During the recording for a speculative 7\" in a little studio in the Belgian countryside, it became quickly evident that the trio had hit upon something worthy of development and their first, self-titled, mini album Minimal Compact was the fruit of this. Their burgeoning style was a heavily Middle-Eastern coloured brand of post-new wave, based on driving rhythms, scratchy guitars and their own very un- \"Anglo-American\" style of vocalisation. In this way they both prefigured alternative dance and later fascinations with so called world music.\nThis mini-album (now re-released on CD along with its successor \"One by One\") features \"Statik Dancin' \" which remained a live staple throughout the band's career, and \"Creation Is Perfect\", based on a text by the beat poet Bob Kaufman.\n",
      "Mission of Burma's history began with a short-lived Boston rock group called Moving Parts. The band included Roger Miller, who had moved to Boston from Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Clint Conley, who came from Darien, Connecticut. When Moving Parts broke up amicably in December 1978, Miller and Conley began practicing. Auditioning new drummers was accomplished, as Michael Azzerad puts it, \"by playing 'out' music, such as Sun Ra and James Brown, until the applicant left.\" They eventually recruited ex-Molls drummer Peter Prescott, who had admired the music of Moving Parts.\n",
      "Durango and Jeff Pezzati were also members of Big Black.\n",
      "The band were keen to sign to a British label, and connected with Factory Records at a Joy Division gig at the Plan K venue in Brussels. The Names, augmented by new drummer Luc Capelle, recorded \"Nightshift\" in Manchester in August 1980 with producer Martin Hannett. The single was representative of their overall sound: dark, controlled modern rock in the mould of Magazine, Comsat Angels and Joy Division/early New Order. It peaked at No. 35 on the UK Indie Chart. In February 1982, the band recorded a session for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show, later released in 2009 as the Radio Session 1982 digital EP.\n",
      "Einheit left the group, eventually to join Einstürzende Neubauten and was replaced by Ralf Hertwig prior to Palais Schaumburg's first full-length album Palais Schaumburg which was produced by David Cunningham and released in 1981. Shortly after it was released, Hiller left the band and started his solo career. He was replaced with Moritz von Oswald and vocalist Walther Thielsch.\n",
      "Richard Witts is now a lecturer and has taught at the University of Edinburgh, Goldsmiths University in London and currently teaches at Edge Hill University in Lancashire. Andy Wilson is a club and radio DJ based mainly in Ibiza. Joe Mckechnie is a producer, remixer, and DJ based in Liverpool. He has released records on Acacia (Detroit), Ochre (UK), Blood (UK) and Aspro (Holland) amongst others. Recent remixes include Ladytron/ROC and Echo & the Bunnymen.\n",
      "In Fitzroy, they settled on a four-piece lineup for recording and found like-minded friends, such as Ollie Olsen and John Murphy of Whirlywirld. They drew influence from proto-punk acts like The Godz and The Velvet Underground, Texan 1960s psychedelic punk, James Brown, and The Silver Apples, as well as Australian bands like Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs.\n",
      "They practiced in a studio in downtown Athens that Lachowski rented from Curtis Crowe, upstairs from the later location of the Grill on College Avenue. The room was lit by a single 40-watt light bulb, so the band referred to it as the \"40 Watt Club\". Crowe, who lived above the studio, recalled hearing Lachowski and Bewley's early rehearsals through the floor: \"a never-ending series of hooks—no bridges or chorus, just hooks\". He soon joined the band as a drummer, stating that he \"had every song memorized\" before he approached them to join. Bewley then approached Vanessa Briscoe (now Vanessa Briscoe Hay) about joining the band on vocals, on the basis that the band were fans of her art work: although she was initially reluctant as she also lacked musical experience, she auditioned for the band on February 14, 1979 and joined the lineup.\n",
      "Rank and File released three albums—two on prominent Los Angeles label Slash Records and a third on the offbeat, retro-oriented Rhino Records.\n",
      "The band was originally named Africa Corps, and was formed by UCLA students Bruce Licher (guitar) and Mark Erskine (drums/percussion). They were joined by Philip Drucker (aka Jackson Del Rey), Robert Loveless, and Jeff Long. Shortly before the release of debut album Tragic Figures in 1982 (on Licher's own Independent Project label) they changed their name to Savage Republic. Licher was also responsible for the group's sleeve designs, which were hand-letterpressed and numbered by him.\n",
      "The band formed in Palo Alto, California, in 1978.  Michael Belfer had been trying to form a band with his friend, Tim Mooney, and Belfer had decided he wanted former Crime drummer Ricky Williams for vocals, as \"he was so awesome looking\".  The band's compositions were spontaneous, as lyricist Williams didn't have the discipline to write out lyrics, but had \"fantastic improvisational abilities\".  The band released a five-track 7-inch EP in late 1978, and then broke up, with Belfer playing in Tuxedomoon during 1978 and 1979, and Williams co-founding Flipper, from which he was fired before the band made any recordings \"for being too weird\".\n",
      "The band broke up in 1981 after Underwater Moonlight. Rew formed the more mainstream pop group Katrina and the Waves, while Hitchcock went on to a prolific career with a similar whimsical, surrealistic style.\n",
      "When Price left the band, the remaining members switched to acoustic music before hiring electric guitarist Arthur Baranoff and bassist Wayne Swickley.\n",
      "They started playing music together in the mid-1970s, when punk rock became popular in the underground music scene. \"The only rule was the tacit understanding that anything that sounded like anyone else was taboo\", stated Brown on the band aiming to create music that sounded unlike anything else before. The vocals were screaming and inspired by punk rock, and the band used any instruments they had around, including saxophones and a polymoog synthesizer. The band had no drummer. Bassist Peter Principle, performance artist Winston Tong and Bruce Geduldig, a filmmaker, joined the band during concerts. The band created new performances for each concert, creating theatrical performances and being described as \"theatrical electronic cabaret\". The band performed frequently with Pere Ubu, The Residents, Devo, and Cabaret Voltaire.\n",
      "A new line-up, led by Currie, was formed in 1992, but achieved limited success, with two albums failing to chart and one solitary single reaching 90 in the UK Singles Chart.\n",
      "During 1978 the band performed more regularly and began to attract a following.  In mid-1978 the drummer left the group and was replaced by Mark Boswell.  Later that year Voigt/645 released a self-funded single made up of two of the songs they had recorded earlier that year – \"State\" and \"A Secret West\". The band had a mid-week residency at the Sussex Hotel and regularly performed at other inner-city venues in Sydney.  Voigt/465 also travelled to Melbourne to perform a series of gigs.\n",
      "In 1988, the band moved to Greg Ginn's SST Records for their 4th release, Farced. The line-up however was the same as on Bumper Crop, including Miller on piano and Waleik on sitar. 1989 brought their most experimental release, Thing of Beauty, also on SST, on which David Kleiler (formerly from the band Sorry) replaced Chuck Hahn on guitar. This would be the Volcano Suns' final line up. The band moved to Chicago-based indie label Quarterstick Records for their final release, Career in Rock in 1991. The album was engineered by Steve Albini, who would later work with Bob Weston in their band Shellac.\n",
      "The band was named Wall of Voodoo before their first gig in reference to a comment made by Joe Berardi, a friend of Ridgway's and member of the Fibonaccis. Berardi was listening to some of the Acme Soundtracks music Ridgway and Moreland had created in their studio. When Ridgway jokingly compared the multiple-drum-machine- and Farfisa-organ-laden recordings to Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, Berardi commented it sounded more like a \"wall of voodoo\" and the name stuck.\n",
      "The pair formed Whirlywirld in 1978 with their stated priority, from the outset, to use synthesisers and other non-'rock' instruments, departing from a guitar-based format. Whirlywirld was completed by two keyboardists, credited with 'electronics', Andrew Duffield and Simon Smith (Olsen, by this point, had abandoned guitar in favour of 'electronics') together with guitarist Dean Richards. Whirlywirld only played live very infrequently but they did rehearse on a rigid schedule.\n",
      "Ellegarden generated a tight, punchy but muscular sound reminiscent of North American bands such as Blink-182, Sum 41 and Good Charlotte, while also displaying the influence of Hosomi's favorites, Weezer. In the fall of 2001, Ellegarden signed with the Japanese Dynamord label, and released their first EP, Bare Foot, with a full-length album, Don't Trust Anyone But Us, following in the spring of 2002. The album was a hit, and Ellegarden followed with a new LP every year. In 2004, they took part in the Synchronized Rockers tribute album to The Pillows. 2006's Eleven Fire Crackers became the band's first North American release when it was issued by Nettwerk in the summer of 2007. Accustomed to playing major shows in Japan, where they've shared stages with the Foo Fighters and Sum 41, Ellegarden made their American live debut in 2006 with a seven-city tour as part of Japan Nite, which included a stop at the South by Southwest Music Conference.\n",
      "Nothing's Carved In Stone moved quickly after their line-up was complete, playing their first live on February 27 at Daikanyama UNIT. Their debut album, Parallel Lives, was released on May 6, 2009 and was followed by two nationwide tours. The album went on to reach the eleventh spot on the Oricon charts. Nothing's Carved In Stone also firmly announced their presence on the Japanese rock scene that year with performances at high-profile events like the SWEET LOVE SHOWER, SUMMER SONIC and the ROCK IN JAPAN FESTIVAL.\n",
      "Bands composed solely of women began to emerge with the advent of rock and roll. Among the earliest all-female rock bands to be signed to a record label were Goldie and the Gingerbreads, to Atlantic Records in 1964, the Pleasure Seekers with Suzi Quatro to Hideout Records in 1964 and Mercury Records in 1968, the Feminine Complex to Athena Records in 1968, and Fanny (who pioneered the all-female band sound in the early to mid-1970s) in 1969 when Mo Ostin signed them to Warner Bros. Records. There were also others, such as the Liverbirds (1962–1967), the Ace of Cups (1967), the Heart Beats (1968), and Ariel (1968–1970) which included the three members of the Deadly Nightshade.\n",

She had known pianist Ichiyo Izawa since attending a solo concert of his in early 2004, though the pair had not talked together often since meeting. She wanted Izawa to join the band for both his piano and songwriting abilities. Sheena contacted Izawa on February 17, 2005, a day after the final date of the Dynamite tour, however Izawa finally agreed in late April. Sheena met Ukigumo through her brother Junpei Shiina, and the pair first collaborated in 2002 as a part of Yokoshima, a band formed to cover the Toto song \"Georgy Porgy\". Ukigumo collaborated with Sheena during the sessions for her album Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana (2003) and Tokyo Jihen's debut album Kyōiku (2004), in which he played the guitars for Sheena's original demos. Sheena liked Ukigumo's guitar playing so much that she left it in for the studio versions of \"Meisai\" and \"Ishiki\", and collaborated on the bonus track \"Ichijiku no Hana\", which was written by him. Ukigumo did not want to join the band at first, however the band found that Ukigumo was the best fitting of all the potential guitarists. He agreed two to three days before Adult's recording sessions began in July 2005. Hiizumi and Hirama's leaving was officially announced on July 1, 2005.  Two months later, the \"Shuraba\" single was announced, and on September 16, 2005, the two new band members, Ichiyo Izawa and Ukigumo were announced officially.\n",
      "In late 2006 and 2007, Sheena briefly resumed solo activities in collaboration with Neko Saito, on Heisei Fūzoku (2007), a soundtrack album for the Mika Ninagawa film Sakuran. The \"OSCA\" single was first announced on May 17, 2007.\n",
      "The song featured lyrics written by Ringo Sheena, and music by Seiji Kameda. It was recorded during sessions for Variety, and was performed during their Spa & Treatment tour in October and November 2007. It was originally titled \"Hood\" (フード) during demo sessions. Kameda was inspired to write the song after seeing a pre-teen girl walking home late at night, with her jacket hood up. Kameda wondered what her future would be like, and created the melody for the song. The first version recorded was \"Put Your Camera Down,\" an English version with lyrics written by Robbie Clark That version was later featured on the Variety Zōkangō vinyl, as well as on the Senkō Shōjo DVD credits. It was eventually released to CD in 2013, on Tokyo Jihen's Hard Disk box set.\n",
      "Drama producer Ikuei Yokochi needed a song that would match the \"strange atmosphere\" of the drama, and thought of Tokyo Jihen when considering a band that could \"project a unique atmosphere, where you're not sure if it's Japanese or Western music\". Sheena, being a fan of screenwriter Satoshi Miki's works accepted the offer, and met with Miki to discuss the song. The drama's team requested a song \"unlike today's chart toppers, but a jazz standard-like song that could be sung on forever.\"\n",
      "The band produced the single \"Oishii Kisetsu\" / \"Ketteiteki Sanpunkan\" for entertainer Chiaki Kuriyama, which was released on March 2, 2011. After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami occurred on March 11, the band released a cover of Tokiko Iwatani's 1964 song \"Yoake no Uta\" to YouTube.\n",
      "Guitarist Ukigumo had previously written songs for the band's Variety album in 2007, most notably the single \"OSCA\". While vocalist Ringo Sheena typically either composed or wrote lyrics for Tokyo Jihen songs, \"Season Sayonara\" is an example of a song written entirely by Ukigumo.\n",
      "The song features lyrics and music by Sheena. The other Color Bars songs were songs that had existed before the release that were suggested but did not appear on other releases. \"Kon'ya wa Karasawagi\" was the final song, which Sheena struggled over on the best way to express. She wrote the lyrics in the image of Tokyo, and wrote the melody in the most natural way she composes songs, without deviating.\n",
      "The concert tour was first announced in September 2004, before the release of the band's first single, \"Gunjō Biyori\". The band released a second single in October, \"Sōnan\", followed by their full-length album Kyōiku in December.\n",
      "After the Dynamite! tour, two of the original members of the band made decisions to leave. Pianist H Zetto M left to focus on his activities with jazz ensemble Pe'z, while guitarist Mikio Hirama left to focus on his activities as a solo musician. Sheena sought new members to replace them, and asked pianist Ichiyo Izawa, who she had known since 2004, and Ryosuke Nagaoka, a guitarist Sheena had met through her brother Junpei Shiina who often collaborated on her demo takes. The band began to record their second album Adult in July 2005.\n",
      "While Sheena acted as the primary songwriter, the band performed songs written by all the band members. Variety (2007) was an album that primarily featured songs composed by Izawa and Ukigumo, and Color Bars (2012) featured five songs, one written by each band member.\n",
      "The next line-up was composed by Miguel Costas, Silvino, Luis and the girls Coral and Rosa, making songs with powerful guitars and fun and surreal lyrics.\n",

      "In the middle of 2003, DarkSun went to Germany to record what would become their debut album. It was recorded at VPS Studios, produced by Ingo Cjavkoski (better known as Rage's producer), and mixed at House of Music Studios by Achim Köhler (mixer who had worked for bands like Primal Fear and Sinner). El Legado was the debut album by the band, released in July 2004. Professional reviews were incredibly good, stating that El Legado, was \"one of the best Spanish metal albums of the year  from an excellent band\". DarkSun toured Spain for a whole year to support the album, and had \"tickets-sold-out\" posters in most of the venues. The critics and live-reviews about this new band were incredibly good. In the middle of the tour, drummer Daniel Cabal left the band. The rest of the members had to cancel some concerts before introducing Cabal's replacement, drummer Rafael Yugueros who was at that time known for his work on power metal band Darna, on their first and second album and left after the band's breakup in 2004. Keyboardist Helena Pinto left the band at the end of 2004.\n",
      "Bassist Álvaro Jardón, left the group on 2002 to form part of power metal band WarCry, where he worked on their second and third studio albums and left at the end of 2003 stating that was all due to personal and musical issues, hoping to return to music on upcoming years. On September 2002 Darna made the official presentation of Jardón's replacement, Fonso a well-known Asturian bassist. Then started their tour to support the debut album, playing on many concerts throughout Spain, where they received very good critics, and showed that Darna was mostly a 'live band'. The band's last concert for the tour was in June, 2003, at that time they started the recording process of what would be their second studio album. The album was scheduled to be released on September 2003, but due to technical problems on the recording sessions they couldn't release it until December, 2003. II was their second album filled with strong rhythms and melodies, where they received even better critics than with the debut album. Second studio album had a great reception on the Spanish heavy metal, but on early 2004 Rafael Yugueros decided to leave the band to form part of DarkSun, where he worked on their second and third studio albums, before joining WarCry on September, 2007 to replace former drummer Alberto Ardines. All the members agreed on breaking up the band and continue on their own. On the middle of 2004 Darna was officially disbanded and all of the members started new projects.\n",
      "In 1981, with some friends, they started the independent label Grabaciones Accidentales (GASA), so they could release their own records.\n",
      "Texts in their lyrics and in the manifestos enclosed with their records are highly offensive and complex, with many references to pop culture: pop music, Spanish folklore, news, publicity, cinema, literature and Spanish and American comics. Armas pal pueblo (1994) was probably the first album made in Spain with a Spanish version of the Parental advisory: Explicit lyrics label on the cover.\n",
      "The quartet released an EP and two studio albums between 2004 and 2006 to little mainstream success. In 2008, Palomo left the band and was replaced by Guillermo Astrain. Delorean subsequently relocated to Barcelona, veering towards more computer-based composition and production. Tiring of the relative low quality of the local dance music scene, the band members created their own eclectic club night, Desparrame, in which they continued the evolution of their music. Remixes for the likes of The xx, Cold Cave, and Franz Ferdinand gave Delorean exposure in the music press.\n",
      "The contract with Everlasting-Caroline only lasted a year and afterwards the band signed with the independent label Subterfuge Records. Their first involvement with the label was to include a demo version of their song \"Loli Jackson\" in the multi-band compilation album Stereoparty 2. This success motivated the label to produce their second album  and so they entered the Infinity Studios in Madrid in 1997 to record the album Devil Came to Me on a tight budget of 80,000 pesetas and in just 20 days. The album was released on April 21, 1997, a fragment of the album's title track (specifically the chorus with the phrase \"I lied for you, I lied for you...\") was included in a popular television commercial by Radical Fruit Company which increased their notoriety and the band was launched to national fame. During the promotion of this album, Álvaro Gómez was replaced by Álvaro Díez in 1997. The album sold over 500,000 copies and gained them fans abroad in Europe and America. They released their official first single from the album, Serenade, a song that, thanks to its strong chorus and catchy melody, managed to become their first number one in Spain. Juan Bullón again directed their next music video. The song \"Loli Jackson\" is featured by director Daniel Calparsoro in the 1997 movie Blinded.\n",
      "The band was active from 1994 to 2006.\n",

Influence by the punk explosion of 1977 they started playing around 1980, the line up consisted of Iosu Expósito on guitar and vocals (declared fan of The Who, The Kinks, The Rolling Stones and the Sex Pistols) and Juanma Suarez on bass and vocals (who didn't really listen to music) later to be joined by Pako Galán on drums. They gave their first concert in a school near their rehearsal space with the audience being a group of 10-year-olds.\n",
      "In 1985 the band formed their own label, Esplendor Geométrico Discos, and released their second LP, Comisario de la Luz / Blanco de Fuerza. \n",
      "They have known each other since childhood, and began testing the waters with the rest of their friends in “”Amenaza Criminal””, in a totally amateur way. With time, only the actual members of the group continued in the world of hip-hop, completing the formation of La Excepción. They discovered they could make rap using their own gypsy slang and they continued to polish their style in small concerts. In one of these they met the ubiquitous MC and producer Frank T, who decided to speed their journey, making first their single “En tu carro paio!” (2002) and then their first record, “”Cata Cheli””, as well as interpreting with them the song \"El negro, el cojo y el gitano\". In addition to the basis provided by Frank T, they relied upon the Frenchman, Super Jeff Dominguez to mix their first CD. Their success among critics and sales has led them to act in the main festivals of the country, like Viña Rock, the Monegros Desert Festival or the Urban Culture de Madrid. All this brought about the re-release of the disc with a DVD and two new tracks.\n",
      "The music of Facto delafé y las flores azules is halfway between indie pop and hip hop, with melodies and structures more characteristic of rock, soul or electronic music. Although the lyrics contain a certain level of criticism, they are more poetic than aggressive.\n",

      "Under this name they released a first single with techno and mod sounds. After this, Gilabert left the band, and Joaquín Almendros (guitar) and Emilio Muñoz (drums) joined it, giving birth to the band's most famous line-up. They moved to Madrid, where the Movida was still ebullient, looking for broader success, and in 1985, they recorded an EP, now as La Guardia, after winning the Villablanca pop-rock festival in the town of Fuengirola.\n",
      "Haemorrhage are, like many goregrind bands, heavily influenced by Carcass, yet still have an identity all their own. \n",
      "According to them, their most significant influences are Sparks, Kraftwerk, Deee-Lite, The Associates (the Mac in Eres PC eres Mac stands for their lead singer, Billy Mackenzie), The Smiths and Morrissey, The Magnetic Fields, Saint Etienne, Pet Shop Boys and British eccentrics like Lawrence, Jarvis Cocker and Luke Haines. They are also influenced by 70's music like German bands La Düsseldorf, Neu! and Harmonia and UK glam acts as Gary Glitter and The Glitter Band.\n",
      "Hinds started in 2011 as a duo called Deers, consisting of Carlotta Cosials and Ana García Perrote. After a break of a year and a half, the duo reformed in 2013. In March 2014, still as a duo, they recorded the tracks \"Bamboo\" and \"Trippy Gum\" and released both songs in Bandcamp as \"Demo\". The single was praised by music magazines including NME and by Paul Lester of The Guardian who chose Deers as \"new band of the week\" in September 2014, and by major musicians, such as Patrick Carney, The Pastels, and Bobby Gillespie.\n",
      "The group's sound began to expand and show more adult concerns with the albums Voy a pasármelo bien (1989) and Ésta es tu vida (1990).  Hombres G went on hiatus after the release of their 1992 album, Historia del bikini.  David pursued a solo career, Rafa and Dani remained involved in the music industry, and Javi devoted time to his bar in Madrid.\n",
      "Their first album featured intimate and whimsical lyrics, wrapped up in progressive rock music. During the next three years they went through various reshuffles in the line-up, and the music grew more complex and elaborated, but the symphonic sound remained until their third album Alkolea.\n",
      "In 2008, the band announced they were going to leave their record company and go independent, founding their own record label Tronco Records. They changed their name to \"Jarabedepalo\" because their former record label had the rights to the name.\n",
      "Although labeled from the beginning as a radical Basque rock, Kortatu tried to fight against any classification, even if political links with Herri Batasuna were evident. They also faced some censorship problems, especially when they tried to add a picture of Spanish monarch Juan Carlos I depicted as a robot. In the five year life span of the band they moved from ska to punk and even hip hop, eventually disbanding the formation after seeing Public Enemy in Paris and creating a bigger project, Negu Gorriak. Although their lyrics also evolved from \"party-ska\" to \"combat-rock\" (in their last record all the songs were sung in Basque), their style along the lines of social and political protest stayed intact.\n",
      "In 2000 the Argentine band Suárez recorded the EP 29:09:00, consisting of 5 cover versions of Le Mans songs.\n",

      "At this point Machetazo stopped being a side project and became a band in its own right, although line-up problems forced them to continue with only two members.  They recorded their first album Carne de Cementerio in 1999, which was released by Razorback Records.  After this they released numerous split singles. With Dopi as the sole surviving original member together with the new guitarist Rober, Machetazo recorded their second full length, Trono de Huesos (2002). In this work the band gives tribute to the seminal grind sound in a work in the vein of bands like Carcass or Repulsion.  After the recording of Trono de Huesos Machetazo created a more stable line-up, that still exists today:  Dopi (drums and vocals); Carlos \"Cadaver\" (bass and vocals); and Rober (guitar).\n",
      "In 1992, the band was a finalist in the \"Concurso Villa de Madrid\", and in 1994, the band released their debut album, produced by Txus and Alberto Plaza under the name Mago de Oz. This album found very little success and people were barely aware of the band's existence. During this time, Mago de Oz went through a period of turbulence and substantial line-up changes, before the line-up that has persisted almost until the present time was formed in 1996. At this point, the lineup consisted of Txus (drums and backing vocals), Mohamed (violin and backing vocals), Carlitos (lead Guitar and backing vocals), Frank (rhythm Guitar, acoustic guitar, and backing vocals), Salva (bass and backing vocals), and José Andrëa (lead Vocals, keyboards).\n",
      "He called Alen Ayerdi - former drummer of Begira - who didn't hesitate to join Kutxi's project. He then contacted Edu Beaumont \"Piñas\", whom he had met one year before. Piñas hadn't played previously in any other band, but Kutxi - who was a very good friend of his - persuaded him to join as bassist. Piñas accepted and introduced Kutxi to César Ramallo, who would become one of Marea's guitarists. David Díaz, aka Kolibrí, also a guitarist, also joined the band.\n",
      "The band's 1999 release Usar y tirar went platinum, leading to the release of their 2001 Unplugged album Sin enchufe. The band released Sopa fría in 2004 under Warner Bros. and Eastwest Records.\n",
      "The unprecedented success also hit Hispanic America. Also, thanks to adaptations to other languages of several of their songs, they influenced non-Spanish speaking countries such as Italy and France, as with their Une femme avec une femme. This foreign song still holds the record for most weeks spent at the top of the French charts. In 2005, Mecano's music was adapted into the successful musical Hoy no me puedo levantar, which opened productions in Spain and Mexico. After two years, it was announced that the musical had been seen by more than 1,500,000 spectators in both countries, making it the most successful original production in Spanish of all times.\n",

      "Flamenco is clearly central to their sound; Ramón Giménez observed \"the magic lies in the flamenco... that is the heartbeat of Ojos de Brujo's songs.\"  However, they are definitely not pure flamenco.  Xavi Turull said: \"...we aren't trying to do flamenco. What we are doing is using the richness of flamenco and the richness of other music to build up something different.  Maybe sometimes I would say that flamenco is the strongest ingredient, but we aren't trying to do flamenco.\"  Upon the release of their first album, Vengue (1999), the flamenco fusion group did receive a lot of skepticism and criticism from the flamenco purists. Many of them refused to acknowledge that the music was true flamenco and that it strayed from its foundation, style and structure.  However, according to the group, their music reflects the past of flamenco and its multicultural roots. The gypsies themselves are diverse and multicultural, a people from the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Iberia. Ojos de Brujos takes this same theme and blends flamenco music with the diverse musical genres of today like hip hop and pop to modernize flamenco. For example Flamenco is combined in their music with other influences including Afro-Cuban, the rap and scratching/turntablism of Hip Hop, and Indian music. The music of Ojos de Brujo uses the drama of flamenco, but carries it along on a steady rhythmic foundation, making the group's music a closer relative to rumba catalana. Usually the focus of Ojos' songs are the vocals by Marina \"La Canillas\" Abad, which move smoothly from gritty flamenco wail to authoritative rapping.  The blend of music opens up their audience base and provides more opportunity to keep creating new types of sounds.\n",
      "After Javier left the band, Eduardo Benavente became also the lead singer. Their sound became darker, departing from the Pegamoides original pop sound and approaching the wave of bands like Gabinete Caligari.\n",
      "The band Els Pets was formed in 1985 in Constantí, by Lluís Gavaldà, Joan Reig and Falin Cáceres. Two female voices joined them, Les Llufes. Unlike the trends of the leading bands that appeared in Barcelona, Els Pets were proud of their rural roots, and therefore marked their own style in opposition to the music that was made in the capital. The result was a bitter, ironic and humoristic complaint against the lack of their region. They name their genuine substyle Rock agrícola (agricultural rock). They began performing concerts in the surrounding villages, coinciding on many occasions with the local celebrations.\n",
      "Pic-Nic soon broke up due to Jeanette's departure and differences between Soler's vision and Hispavox's demands. In 1969, the label reissued their only album with a new track listing under the title Cállate niña. Following the group's dissolution, Soler formed the progressive rock band Om, enlisting de Montaberry and Sabatés. On the other hand, Jeanette was recontacted by Hispavox and launched a successful solo career as a balladeer with the single \"Soy rebelde\" in 1971. Pic-Nic has since attained cult status and is celebrated for its California sound that set them apart from other local groups of their time. Their only full-length record was reissued in 2011 and has appeared in various critics' lists for the best Spanish pop music albums of all time.\n",

They were the among the first bands to popularize the use of Galician in a rock song. Their most recognizable hit was \"Fai un Sol de Carallo\" (1986), a folk-inflected politic-danceable rock song that would become an anthem for the Movida viguesa.  Due to its success, it was also translated into English and Basque.  Other famous songs included \"Galicia Sitio Distinto\" and \"Galicia Express\", criticizing the state of Galicia with comical and irreverent lyrics. Their 1990 album Jei (the title song parodying the Julio Iglesias's singing style) was critically acclaimed and was declared the best national album of the year by Rockdelux magazine.\n",

      "After Krysálida, Leo formed with Patricio Babasasa (drums) and Edu Fernández (bass) Azabel, a band with a more aggressive style, close to death, and it was at this time when the idea of making a version of Mecano's song \"Hijo de la luna\" was brought up, a proposal that Stravaganzza would bring to life ten years later. Azabel dissolved after Leo's departure to well-known heavy metal band Saratoga, in which he would at last get recognition, fame and prestige, and where he would stay for eight years. On his side, Pepe Herrero, after abandoning Krysálida, wouldn't participate in any musical group until 2000, in which he founded Eklectika, a personal project in which, among others, he would compose some of the songs that later would appear on Stravaganzza's first album. \n",
      "The band is considered to be one of the best live band of the country ever.\n",
      "After Juan Luis Suárez joined David and Raquel in 2003, they decided to find a new name for the band. They considered names like \"Pupitre Azul\" (Blue Desk) or \"La Hija del Caos\" (The Daughter of Chaos), and eventually chose El Sueño de Morfeo.\n",
      "They were influenced by The Who, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, and Lou Reed\n",
      "Tequila release four studio albums, and were working in a fifth before their first breakup. The song \"Me estás atrapando otra vez\", intended for the further, would finally appear in the Los Rodriguez album Sin documentos.\n",
      "In 1980, Triana released their fourth album, Un encuentro. A commercial success, the album demonstrated a much more commercial and pop rock-influenced sound. Its follow-up, 1981's Un mal sueño, featured a similar sound, as did their sixth album, 1983's Llegó el día. Shortly after the release of Llegó el día, de la Rosa Luque was killed in a car accident, and the band subsequently announced their break-up.\n",
      "The band started in 2007, playing all around Catalonia. Together with Manu Chao, Gambeat, Radio Bemba and Che Sudaka, they took part in La Pegatina's debut album, Al Carrer (Self-publishing, 2007), featuring in La Pegatina's first single Penjat. They ended that year on 2 November in Sala KGB Barcelona, with a shared concert with La Pegatina, a sold-out concert.\n",
      "The formation changed again with the exit of Manolo and the arrival of Nano before their fourth disc, \"Esperando al viento\" in 1995. After \"A cara de perro,\" out in 1998, \"Senderos de este infierno,\" their first Live Disc, came out in 1999, followed by their seventh album, \"Bulla\" in 2000.\n",
      "In 2002 they played with bands such as Bad Religion, Jimmy Eat World or Dover. Then, toured with Joshua and again, this time with Maple.\nAnd after those tours they entered the studio to record their second LP, called 'An Investment in Logistics' in December 2002.\n",
      "Lupe Vázquez died in 1993. The remaining Vulpes reformed for a concert in 2005. An album of rerecordings, Me Gusta Ser, was released in 2006.\n",
      "\"WarCry\" had always been Víctor García's idea of a band. In 1992 he formed a band named War-Cry, playing as guitarist, but disbanded it in 1994 when he became the rhythm guitarist for Avalanch. After leaving Avalanch, in February 1996 he reformed the group as WarCry, this time acting as songwriter and lead vocalist. They recorded a demo entitled Demon 97, but disbanded again a year later when Víctor rejoined Avalanch as lead singer.  After being expelled from Avalanch, Víctor showed Ardines the name and logo of WarCry. Ardines felt that those were \"fantastic\", and that they should continue working on their new musical project, as they already had an \"open path\".\n",
      "The first album of 1976 \"1976-1\" was published by themselves in 1999. Then their second album ”Sense of direction”(2000) and third album “Encourage with love” (2001) received awards from The Association of Music Workers in Taiwan. The albums were released on Taiwanese indie label Crystal Records.\n",
      "The current band title is a dedication of saying \"Dong Cheng's Band\" ('Dong Cheng' is Jiro Wang's Chinese name).\n",
      "In June 2014, their debut album Angle was released, with singles featuring Panai Kusui and Enno Cheng.   In December 2014, the group members announced a year long hiatus due to Taiwanese compulsory military service, and held a performance entitled See You Then in addition to a short documentary of the same name.\n",
      "After signing to the independent music label “Black Market Music Production”, the band released their first five-single EP “Plankton of the City” in Aug 2014, which was highly recommended by many noted musicians and critics in Taiwan and China. In January 2015, Hello Nico released some songs from their first album “Familiar Desolation” on the Internet. Many of the songs monopolized the first place of the ranking list for weeks. In February 2015, the band started to sell their album for the first time, and only digital download. As of January 2016, their music video ‘Flower’ had been hit over 1 million times on YouTube.\n",
      "The two guitar players – Tsai Hai-en (蔡海恩) and Ke Jen-chien (柯仁堅) – share lead vocals.  Both attended National Taiwan University but left school early.  Between the two of them they have driven the band's evolution.  The critic Malaite attributes the group's early grunge influence to Tsai.   In addition to Western influences, both of them are, in their own ways, steeped in local, traditionally working class genres.  There is also a bass player and a drummer.\n",
      "In May 2001,  Sodagreen competed in the Golden Melody Cup held by the National Chengchi University and won the Best Popularity award with the composition \"Peeping\". With the support of Shiao-Ying, a judge at the competition, it recorded \"Peeping\" for the compilation Taiwan independent compilation 2001, released by TCM. In April the next year, after several changes to the line-up of the band (guitarists), Sodagreen participated in the Golden Melody Cup again, this time winning the awards for Best Band, Best Composition, Best Lyrics and Best Music.\n",
      "The band's Chinese name, 老王樂隊 (Lǎowáng yuèduì), directly translates to \"Old Wang Band.\" In Chinese, \"Old Wang\" is often used as slang for the man next door who his wife has an affair with. This is the origin of the band's English name, \"Your Woman Sleep With Others.\"\n"
