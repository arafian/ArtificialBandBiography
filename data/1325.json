         "Alan Ward had toured Belgium with Bastard. Through his connections there, he had his new moniker, Elton Motello, debut on the Belgian label Pinball with the single \"Jet Boy, Jet Girl\" in 1977. The song was backed by session musicians[3] Mike Butcher (guitar), John Valcke (bass), and Bob Dartsch (drums), instead of Elton Motello's regular musicians. That exact same backing track was simultaneously used by Belgian artist Plastic Bertrand on his internationally successful hit single \"Ça plane pour moi\". Since then, \"Jet Boy, Jet Girl\" has sometimes been wrongly thought to be a cover of \"Ça plane pour moi\", with new lyrics over the same backing track,[1] but the truth is that the two songs were simultaneous adaptations of the same backing track.[4]\n",
         "While Bertrand's single was an international hit, Motello's single in English made little impact, except in Australia, where it was released on the RCA label and hit #33 on the National Top Forty (and regionally in Melbourne at #11 and in Sydney, at #10). Also in Australia, \"Jet Boy, Jet Girl\" has appeared in a television commercial, though the commercial only included the chorus and none of the once-controversial lyrics.\n"
