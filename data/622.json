         "Cacadou Look was a five-piece pop rock band from Opatija, Croatia that was the first Yugoslav all-female band to release a long play record.[2][3]\n",
         "Cacadou Look was formed in Opatija in 1983.[4] They were not the first all-female band in Yugoslavia — at the time, already active were Tožibabe from Ljubljana and Boye from Novi Sad[4] — but they were the first to achieve a degree of mainstream popularity, helped by radio play of their two demo tracks, \"Sama\" and \"Kao pjesma\" (both 1987),[2] and by TV appearances such as those on Stereovizija,[4] a popular 1980s music show broadcast by Radio Television Zagreb.[5]\n",
         "Their first album Tko mari za čari (Jugoton, 1987) was produced by Husein Hasanefendić and Tomo in der Mühlen,[2][6] and featured a guest appearance by Vlada Divljan. The album yielded three hit songs: \"Sama\", \"Kao pjesma\" and \"Tako lako\". Apart from \"Tako lako\", a cover of Buddy Holly's \"It's So Easy\",[2][6] and \"Ne dozvoli\", which was written by Divljan,[2] all songs on the album were composed by the band.[6] Despite these accomplishments, the band found working in the men-dominated music scene difficult at times, and occasional malicious remarks motivated them to work even harder.[7]\n",
         "Their second and equally successful[4] album Uspavanka za Zoroa was released in 1989. Hit tracks from the album were \"Baum bam bam\", \"Budi mi prijatelj\", and \"Krenite s nama\",[4] the latter a cover of Bryan Ferry's \"Let's Stick Together\".[2] An English version of \"Budi mi prijatelj\" — named \"Be My Friend\" — was also recorded, appearing on Yu-Go Pop (Jugoton, 1990),[8] a compilation of Yugoslav pop and rock artists performing their songs in English.\n",
         "Cacadou Look played their last gig in Zagreb on 25 May 1991.[4] Members of the band were not willing to start solo careers — seeing them as meaningless without the band teamwork — and left the music scene.[7]\n"
