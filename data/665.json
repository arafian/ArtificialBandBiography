      "Girl In a Coma was an American indie rock band from San Antonio, Texas, United States, formerly on Joan Jett's Blackheart Records' label.  The band consisted of Nina (vocals/guitar), Phanie Diaz (drums) and Jenn Alva (bass). The name is a reference to The Smiths' song \"Girlfriend in a Coma\". Before they were called Girl in a Coma, they were known as Sylvia's Radio and Girls in a Coma.\n",
      "Stephanie \"Phanie\" Diaz started learning how to play the acoustic guitar when she was eleven. Jenn Alva and Phanie met in eighth grade in art class where they became best friends. Both of them played instruments and created Girl in a Coma.\n",
      "The partners asked Phanie's younger sister, Nina Diaz, to join their band after she shared with them a song she had written. Her first show was a week before her 14th birthday. Nina left high school at 16 to focus on the band. In 2009, Nina collaborated with Tiësto to co-write the dance track, \"In Your Mind.\" At the start of 2014, Nina took a break from the band to record solo material.\n"
