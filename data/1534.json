      "Chirinuruwowaka (チリヌルヲワカ), is a Japanese rock band formed in 2005 by Yumi Nakashima, known from the band GO!GO!7188.\n",
      "The band name comes from one sentence of the classical Japanese alphabet “Iroha”, pronounced Chi-ri-nu-ru-wo-wa-ka.\n",
      "Initially, Nakashima was going to produce her second solo album.\nThrough the recording of her previous work which is her first solo album Ten no Mikaku, she recognized that she cannot express herself other than the band-style. So she intended to produce the next solo album with a band.\nNakashima wanted to form a serious band which incorporated young power and the band was to be formed.\nShe first invited bassist Iwai, whom she was always interested in although knowing him only by a recorded performance, to GO!GO!7188’s tour, and she met him for the first time.\nShe formally asked him to join the band.\nThen Nakashima chose drummer Abe who participated in the recording of her solo album after some sessions with several drummers.\nFinally Nakashima auditioned guitarists, and Miyashita who was 20 years old passed it.\n"
