         "Fighting Instinct was a Christian rock band formed in Winston-Salem/Greensboro, North Carolina. It was founded by TJ Harris and Dallas Farmer. They played together for several years before they met up with Jason Weekly in the Winston-Salem/Greensboro area. Jason Weekly came up with the band's name.\n",
         "They released their first CD, Fighting Instinct, in mid-2006. The first single off this album, \"I Found Forever,\" was featured on both rock and Christian radio stations. \"I Found Forever\" rose to No. 31 on the active rock charts with virtually no touring. The band's Christian single, \"Back to You\", reached No. 5 on the Christian CHR charts. \"Back to You\" and \"Just to Please You\" were only released to Christian radio stations. In October 2008, the band announced on their MySpace that they were releasing a five-song EP, but also announced they were going to disband at the end of the year.\n",
         "Their Lead Vocalist, TJ Harris, joined the band Decyfer Down in 2008.\n",
         "Later, in 2016, Harris reported in an interview that he left Fighting Instinct because Decyfer Down had asked him to join them.[8]\n"
