         "Tilt is an American punk rock band from the East Bay, California, United States, formed in 1992.[1] The group's debut studio album, Play Cell, was released through Lookout Records in 1993. They would soon after get signed to Fat Wreck Chords, which the rest of its albums were released through.[2] The band consisted of Cinder Block (vocals), Jeffrey Bischoff (guitar), Pete Rypins (bass), and Vincent Camacho (drums). Starting on February 15, 1994 at the Cattle Club in Sacramento and ending on April 6, 1994 in Vancouver, Tilt supported Green Day on their Dookie tour.\n",
         "Tilt's song \"Crying Jag\" appears on the soundtrack for the film Glory Daze (1996).[3] Tilt broke up for a short time in 1996 but reunited in 1997 with Jimi Cheetah of Screw 32.[4] They were scheduled to play a one-night-only reunion show on May 13, 2011 at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California but had to cancel because the bass player injured his arm needing surgery. The show was never rescheduled.[5] However, Tilt played a one-off reunion show in the fall of 2015 as a part of a two-day festival to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Fat Wreck Chords. They played another reunion show on January 1, 2017 at 924 Gilman Street.[6]\n",
