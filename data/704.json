      "text": [
         "The band is named after a love hotel in Osaka[4] near the high school of one of the band members.[2] They formed in 2009 while the members were active in the \"Rock Commune\" music club at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto.[3][5] The original members were Accorinrin on lead vocals, Yoyoyoshie on guitar, Pop on drums, and Nishikawachi on bass.\n",
         "In June 2011, Otoboke Beaver released a demo CD featuring three songs, including an early version of \"Chuchu Song\", a live track that would be later re-recorded and distributed to people who helped fund the band's first trip to the United States.\n",
         "In 2012, the group released their first live album through Egypt Records. In 2013, they released a limited-edition single through Jet Set Records, featuring the newly recorded \"Otobokebeaver Daijikenbo\" and two live tracks. In March of the same year, the band released the mini-album Love Me Sign. Bassist Nishikawachi left the band in 2013 and was replaced by Hiro-Chan, a fan who asked to join via e-mail.[6]\n",
         "Otoboke Beaver participated in Record Store Day 2015, releasing the single \"Akimahenka\" on vinyl. In 2016, the band signed with UK-based label Damnably. The Okoshiyasu!! Otoboke Beaver compilation album was released, featuring the majority of the songs found on the group's first two mini-albums, with the addition of the \"Akimahenka\" track. The band recorded a live session  on XFM and toured the UK with Shonen Knife and Leggy. The EP Bakuro Book followed shortly thereafter, with another EP titled Love is Short!! appearing the following year for Record Store Day 2017. The song \"Love Is Short!!\" reached the UK singles chart.[7]\n",
         "The band began touring internationally in 2016, including dates at the 100 Club in London and SXSW in the United States in 2017.[8] Their trip to SXSW was financially assisted by fan-funding via Campfire and Kickstarter.[9] In 2018, the band traveled over 24,000 miles in one week to play two slots at the Coachella Festival[10] and a three-date headlining tour in the UK with label-mates Say Sue Me and Leggy. Other notable tour-mates have included The Cribs, Miyavi, Guitar Wolf, and Wussy.\n",
         "The album Okoshiyasu!! Otoboke Beaver was re-released on vinyl for Record Store Day in 2018.[11] In that year, founding drummer Pop announced her departure from the band.[12] Pop was replaced by Kahokiss, who had attended the same university music club as the band's founding members almost a decade before.\n",
         "In March 2019, Otoboke Beaver performed at SXSW in Austin, Texas.[13][14] The album Itekoma Hits, featuring new songs and compiling some previously-released singles, was released by Damnably in April 2019. The non-album single \"Yobantoite Mojo\" was released in late 2019; the song also served as the theme song for the Japanese TV comedy Susumu Inomata and 8 Mojo.[15]\n"

         "Otoboke Beaver's music has garnered them praise from the likes of Pitchfork[16] (\"even if their music is not explicitly feminist, there is power in hearing a group of four Asian women say exactly what they want\"),[17] and also from NPR,[18] The Fader,[19] Stereogum,[20] i-D,[21] and Fujirock Express.[22]\n",
         "In 2017, they were nominated for Best Live Act at the AIM Independent Music Awards.[23] They have been featured on BBC6 radio.[24]\n"
