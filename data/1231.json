         "The band is named after its lead singer María who was born in Puerto Rico and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. She and her partner Josh Conway, the drummer, met at a show at the Kibitz Room, which is described as a low-key nook in West Hollywood [3] next to Canter's Deli. She was performing on the bill and he was managing the sound, something he had never done before. They began writing almost immediately after meeting, and subsequently began dating.[4] Soon they recruited close friends to join as band members; Edward James on keyboards, guitarist Jesse Perlman, and bassist Carter Lee.[5] They were offered an opportunity to make songs for television, which helped them understand the visual and sonic feel that they were striving for [3] but when it didn't materialize, they used their recordings to make an EP, entitled Superclean Vol. I.[2] Vol. I was released in 2017, while its counterpart Vol. II was released in 2018.[6]\n"
