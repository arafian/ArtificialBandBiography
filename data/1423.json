      "The Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players were an American indie-rock/art pop family band. It consisted of main vocalist Jason Trachtenburg, his wife Tina, and their only child, Rachel.\n",
      "The band's members consisted of father, Jason Trachtenburg, who played guitar and piano and sang; mother, Tina Piña, who ran the slide projector and was a backup vocalist; and daughter, Rachel, who played the drums and sang backup. Born on December 10, 1993, Rachel was only six years old when she began performing publicly.\n",
      "Their trademark was the slideshow itself: slides collected from \"estate sales, garage sales, thrift stores, etc.\" were constantly shown in order to \"turn the lives of annonymous   strangers into pop-rock musical exposs based on the contents of these slide collections\". The band sings about things that occurred in the places shown in the slides, such as public execution (Mountain Trip to Japan, 1959) and McDonald's' competitors (Wendy's, Sambo's and Long John Silver's) \"using network television to take advantage of efficiency\".\n"
