      "LTK Commune (aka LTK, Taiwanese: Lô-chúi-khoe Kong-siā 濁水溪公社) is a well-known Taiwanese \"underground\" band founded in 1990.  Their music has been variously described as having elements of punk, rock, nakasi, Taiwanese folk songs.  In recent years band members have self-consciously applied the label \"Taik\" (from Taiwanese + -k ending, as in punk, rock) to their music – a reference to the Taiwanese Taike (Trad.: 台客) subculture.\n",
      "The LTK stands for \"Loh Tsui Kweh\", an idiosyncratic spelling (in Taiwanese) of the name of the Choshui River in Taiwan, one that evokes nativist sentiments.\n",
      "The two guitar players – Tsai Hai-en (蔡海恩) and Ke Jen-chien (柯仁堅) – share lead vocals.  Both attended National Taiwan University but left school early.  Between the two of them they have driven the band's evolution.  The critic Malaite attributes the group's early grunge influence to Tsai. [1]  In addition to Western influences, both of them are, in their own ways, steeped in local, traditionally working class genres.  There is also a bass player and a drummer.\n",
      "LTK Commune's earlier music echoes the island's protest movements of the early 1990s.  Earlier themes have consciously reflected environmentalist concerns and anti-authoritarian sentiments.  With the decline of street protests and the onset of political liberalization, socially conscious themes have become less foregrounded.  The band unabashedly supports Taiwan independence.\n"
