   "Early history": {
      "text": [
         "The band first began when percussionists Derrick Moss and Lumar LeBlanc met as members of Harold Dejan's Young Olympia Brass Band and decided they wanted to play the music they were hearing on pop radio, but within the context and with respect to the long tradition of the New Orleans brass bands and marching bands they had grown up playing in. The Soul Rebels played around New Orleans without a proper band name until opening up for Cyril Neville at the legendary New Orleans venue Tipitina's, where Cyril Neville dubbed them \"Soul Rebels.\"[3]  The Soul Rebels built up their following in hometown New Orleans as the house band every Thursday night at local favorite bar Le Bon Temps Roule, a residency they still continue currently when the band isn't on tour.[4]  The band is still considered a main drawing point for people to come experience the venue.[2]\n",
         "Since 2009, The Soul Rebels have been managed by music industry heavyweight Ted Kurland, proprietor of the prestigious booking and management agency Ted Kurland Associates, Adam Shipley, president of Hep Cat Entertainment and Alex Kurland of the Blue Note Entertainment Group.[5]\n"
