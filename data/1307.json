      "War Tapes is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 2006. The band has played shows and toured across the US and in the UK with The Smashing Pumpkins, Tiger Army, Shiny Toy Guns, Moving Units, The Bravery, Longwave, VNV Nation, She Wants Revenge, Mark Burgess of The Chameleons, Elefant, Jonathan Richman, and The Unseen. Their songs \"Dreaming Of You\" and \"The Night Unfolds\" were featured on Last Call with Carson Daly; the song \"Mind Is Ugly\" was featured on a Season 5 episode of the MTV series The Hills, and the band also performed on the season 2 finale of the ABC Family show Greek. They define their sound as: \"Heart-Quaking Doom Pop\" and they released their first full-length album, The Continental Divide in May 2009.\n",
      "The band is composed of brother and sister Neil and Becca Popkin, Matthew Bennett, and William Mohler. Neil and Becca originally hail from Boston, Matt was born in Hawaii, and William was born in Southern California. Recently, the band added longtime friend Ian Sterling Smith, formerly of Sleepmask, to play during live performances. The band was formed in Downtown Los Angeles in 2004 (according to their Myspace page), and they made their live debut in 2006. The band played anywhere they could get booked, including warehouse parties and small punk clubs, and also some higher profile venues like The Wiltern, the Bowery Ballroom and The Warfield. The band arguably played its biggest show in San Francisco in 2007, opening for the reformed Smashing Pumpkins at the Fillmore. According to Neil, it also marked a turning point in the band. He stated: \"...To see how hard they (Smashing Pumpkins) worked and how much they rehearsed, we decided we needed to step it up.\" After more touring and shows the band released a six-song, self-titled EP at the end of 2008.\n",
      "War Tapes closed out the year with more live performances in the Los Angeles area and in early 2009, they completed work on their debut LP, The Continental Divide. Four songs off of their EP were remixed and remastered for The Continental Divide. The entire record was written and recorded in Los Angeles, mostly at Regime Studios. William also serves as the band's producer. In the 11 weeks leading up to the release, the band debuted one new song on their Myspace page every Sunday at midnight. The record was released on May 26, 2009. The band then held two CD release parties, one at Club Moscow in Hollywood, CA, and another in Orange County, California. The album has received several positive reviews from websites including: Ripplemusic, Indiemusicnews, Indieblips, Shakefire.com, and Post-Punk.com.\n"
