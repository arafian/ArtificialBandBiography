            "The band is composed of brother and sister Neil and Becca Popkin, Matthew Bennett, and William Mohler. Neil and Becca originally hail from Boston, Matt was born in Hawaii, and William was born in Southern California. Recently, the band added longtime friend Ian Sterling Smith, formerly of Sleepmask, to play during live performances. The band was formed in Downtown Los Angeles in 2004 (according to their Myspace page), and they made their live debut in 2006. The band played anywhere they could get booked, including warehouse parties and small punk clubs, and also some higher profile venues like The Wiltern, the Bowery Ballroom and The Warfield. The band arguably played its biggest show in San Francisco in 2007, opening for the reformed Smashing Pumpkins at the Fillmore. According to Neil, it also marked a turning point in the band. He stated: \"...To see how hard they (Smashing Pumpkins) worked and how much they rehearsed, we decided we needed to step it up.\"[1] After more touring and shows the band released a six-song, self-titled EP at the end of 2008.\n"

            "War Tapes closed out the year with more live performances in the Los Angeles area and in early 2009, they completed work on their debut LP, The Continental Divide.

         "War Tapes define their sound as \"Heart-Quaking Doom Pop\", at times being compared to The Cure, Depeche Mode, and Joy Division. However, the band themselves have stated they are inspired more by bands that they don't actually sound like.[9] Becca is a classically trained pianist and guitarist. William was trained in jazz bass and guitar, while Matt played in several shoegaze and punk bands before joining War Tapes. Becca and William had also never played (bass and drums, respectively) in a band before booking their first gig in 2006. Neil states that although he did musical theatre back in High School, his voice was still highly undeveloped upon the band's inception. He took vocal lessons and continuously practiced to improve.[10]\n"
