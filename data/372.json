            "The band started touring more and tension between band members started building up. After appearing on the \"Chicago vs. Amsterdam\" split EP, 88 Fingers Louie disbanded in late 1996 due to fights between band members, and vocalist Denis Buckley allegedly having urinated on drummer Glenn Porter. However, shortly before disbanding, the band had recorded a new 7\" single, \"The Teacher Gets it\", which was released in early 1997. Later the same year, Fat Wreck Chords released a compilation album of all the band's 7\" releases on the label titled \"The Dom Years\".\n",
            "However, in 1998 the band decided to start things up again, this time with new, and current drummer, John Carroll. The band released its second album, \"Back on the Streets\", and the band went back on tour. Things seemed well, but internal fights once again tore the band apart. Only weeks after releasing a split album with Kid Dynamite, the band disbanded due to vocalist Denis Buckley and bassist Joe Principe getting into a fight.\nVocalist Denis Buckley went on to sing in the melodic hardcore band Explode and Make Up,[2] previous drummer Glenn Porter started playing for Alkaline Trio after leaving 88 Fingers Louie, last drummer John Carroll went on to drum for Paper Mice, while Dan Wleklinski and Joe Principe formed the band Rise Against.[3]\n"
