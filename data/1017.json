      "text": [
         "The group formed in 2000 with original keyboard player Marc Scortino and released their first studio effort \"Shed Tech\" a year later. In 2002 Scortino left the band and was replaced by Todd Stoops. Along with Chris Michetti (Guitar), Jay Burwick (Bass) and Greg Stukey (Drums) the band would release their second album \"Carbohydrates Are The Enemy\" later in the year and embark on their first national tour. In 2006 Harmonized Records signed RAQ and helped release their third studio album \"Ton These\". In 2013 the band re-formed with Adrian Tramantano on drums.\n",
         "In a 2004 article, music writer Eric Ward Glide Magazine stated, \"They've invented the concept of jambands even having an old school style to bring back in the first place.\"[1]\n",
         "RAQ ended a 20-month hiatus with the announcement of a show on April 30, 2010 at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City. During the hiatus, Chris Michetti toured with his own band called Michetti. The band originally included Rob O'Dea on bass and Tim Sharbough on drums. Sharbough was eventually replaced by Greg Stukey. Jay Burwick opened with a solo acoustic set for Michetti on a short tour in early 2009, usually joined by Michetti for one or two songs. Michetti usually performed a mix of new songs and various covers, while Burwick performed a mix of new songs, humorous covers, and older RAQ songs.\n",
         "Todd Stoops co-founded his project, Kung Fu.  The band is composed of Chris DeAngelis on bass, Tim Palmieri on guitar, Adrian Tramantano on drums, and Rob Somerville on tenor and soprano saxophone.\n"
