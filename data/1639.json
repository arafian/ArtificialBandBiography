            "The band was originally formed in 2002 under the name Xemá, with a clear influence of Asturian folk music.[2] Their debut album, Del interior, was released that same year, but failed to generate commercial success. This album was recorded while David Feito, from Asturias himself, and Raquel del Rosario, from the Canary Islands, were at the Colegio Internacional Meres in Siero, Asturias, together with teachers Andrés Alonso (keyboard and accordion) and Antón Fernández (bass guitar and guitar). After the launch of this first album, the band had to decide if they would go on as Xemá or create a new project, opting for the latter.\n"

            "Their first album as El Sueño de Morfeo, an eponymous album, came out in March 2005, produced by Manel Santisteban. Their first single \"Nunca volverá\" had been released in January 2005, becoming an instant sales hit in Spain. It ranked third on the year-end singles chart.[4] Their following singles, \"Ojos de cielo,\" \"Okupa de tu corazón\" and \"Esta soy yo\" cemented their popularity. They toured Spain with more than 100 concerts and they did a promo tour through Latin America. That same year they took part in a tribute album to Duncan Dhu, where they covered \"Una calle de París\".\n",
            "In 2006, they recorded a cover of \"I Will Survive\" for a Cruzcampo spot, titled \"Tómate la vida\". Raquel recorded a duet with Diego Martín, \"Déjame verte\", and El Sueño de Morfeo recorded the Spanish version of \"Our Town\", \"Reencontrar\", for the Spanish edition of the Cars Movie Soundtrack. The launch campaign of television channel La Sexta featured them as well, with their song \"Sonrisa especial\".\n"
