      "The Del McCoury Band is a Grammy award-winning bluegrass band.\n",
      "Originally the band was called Del McCoury and the Dixie Pals with Del on guitar and his brother Jerry on bass. The band went through a number of changes in personnel until the 1980s when the band solidified its line-up, adding McCoury's sons, Ronnie and Robbie on mandolin and banjo, respectively. In 1988, the \"Dixie Pals\" name was dropped in favor of the current name. Fiddler Tad Marks and bass player Mike Brantley joined in the early 1990s while the band became a national touring act.\n",
      "In 1999 the Del McCoury band was named \"Entertainer of the Year\" at the International Bluegrass Music Awards.\n"
