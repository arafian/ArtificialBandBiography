         "Gypsy was an American progressive rock band from Minnesota, formed as The Underbeats (1962â€“1968).[1][2] Gypsy was the house band at the Whisky a Go Go, West Hollywood, California from September 1969 to April 1971 and were known in 1970 for their US Billboard Hot 100 single \"Gypsy Queen Part 1\". Most of Gypsy's music was composed and written by guitarist and singer Enrico Rosenbaum. Drummer Bill Lordan went on to play with Sly & the Family Stone and a long career with Robin Trower. Keyboardist James Walsh continued the band in various incarnations as The James Walsh Gypsy Band.[2]\n",
         "The group has no relation to the British band of the same name formed in 1968, who recorded two albums for United Artists Records in the UK.\n"
