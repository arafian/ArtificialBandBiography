         "Pinhead Gunpowder was an American punk rock band that formed in East Bay, California, in 1990. The band currently consists of Aaron Cometbus (drums, lyrics), Bill Schneider (bass), Billie Joe Armstrong (guitar, vocals) and Jason White (guitar, vocals). The band's name comes from a brand of \"high octane\" green tea served at the Arcata co-op and discovered by Aaron Cometbus during one of his many dumpster diving adventures.\n"

         "Pinhead Gunpowder was founded in Arcata, California, in January 1991 by Aaron Cometbus and Jon Quittner. Cometbus wanted the name \"Pinhead Gunpowder\", while Quittner wanted to call it \"50 Foot Hesher\". Along with vocalist Doug \"Douggie Grime\" Rogers and bassist David \"Atlas\" Kimmel, the band played once at a party where Cometbus snapped his bass pedal in half in the middle of the set. Shortly after the show, Cometbus moved back to Berkeley, taking the name of the band and some of the songs with him. Quittner stayed in Arcata with the band and they changed their name to 50 Foot Hesher and acquired a new drummer. A few months later, Quittner left the band and the remaining members changed the name to \"Lank\". \n",
         "Back in Berkeley, Cometbus formed the second incarnation of Pinhead Gunpowder with Bill Schneider and Sarah Kirsch of The Skinflutes, and Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day. In June 1991 they recorded their first EP, Tründle and Spring. It was not until April of the following year that the band played their first live show at Punks With Presses in Oakland along with Rancid and The Gr'Ups. The band then released their second EP, Fahizah. In 1993, Kirsch left the band citing personal differences with Armstrong's decision to sign to a major label with Green Day.  Kirsch was replaced by Jason White of Chino Horde. Shortly after, the band embarked on a week long tour of Northern California, Oregon, and Washington in the winter of 1994.\n"

         "Aaron Cometbus is the primary writer of Pinhead Gunpowder's songs. During Pinhead Gunpowder's first incarnation, Cometbus and Quittner wrote a handful of songs together, including \"In Control\", \"Losers of the Year\", \"Certain Things\", \"Brother\", \"I Used To\", \"Stab You in the Eye\", and \"Cuidado\" (The last two songs released by Quittner and Cometbus under the band name \"Mundt\"). Cometbus often borrows songs recorded by his other bands to release as Pinhead Gunpowder songs, including \"Train Station\" from Shotwell Coho, \"The Great Divide\" from Redmond Shooting Stars, \"Asheville\" from Cleveland Bound Death Sentence, and \"On the Ave\" and \"Landlords\" from Astrid Oto. Only three Pinhead Gunpowder songs have been written by Billie Joe Armstrong, under the name \"Wilhelm Fink\". Those are \"27\", \"New Blood\", and \"Anniversary Song\". \n"
