      "Candygram for Mongo was founded in 2005 by drummer Gary Sharp and vocalist and guitarist Tony Shea. The two had been friends for five years when they discovered a mutual interest in music. Sharp and Shea began rehearsing and writing together with the idea of creating a studio project. They enlisted the help of Johnny Dwinell (also known as \"Johnny D\"), a producer and musician from Los Angeles by way of Nashville who was impressed with the unique sound of the band and officially joined Candygram For Mongo as the guitarist. The band also recruited Dan Cohen, a top notch studio musician who has played and recorded with many musicians, including members of the Gigolo Aunts, Happy Stars, The Posies, The Rembrandts, and Dogs Eye View, to become the band's permanent bassist despite his background primarily as a guitarist. The band added bassist James Baker in 2008, allowing Cohen to become the group's primary guitarist. Johnny Dwinell left the group shortly after Baker joined.\n",
      "The band's first public show was on September 3, 2006 at the Viper Room in Los Angeles.\n"
