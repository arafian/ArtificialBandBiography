         "Aventuras de Kirlian was a Spanish indie rock band in the 1980s. Although they experienced only moderate commercial success, they achieved a significant cult following in the Basque country, and their music has been a major influence on many Spanish bands of the 1990s. The band dissolved in 1989 and the members teamed up with drummer Gorka Ochoa to form a new group under the name of Le Mans.\n"
