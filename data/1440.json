         "Saagar (Virgin Records; CD; Rs. 199, Cassette; Rs. 65) features 12 tracks, with a common strain of pop melodies blended with Pakistani classical and folk vocals. The opening track Aakhon Kay Saagar gave rise to their popularity within Pakistan. Following songs, Akhiyaan, Terey Bina and Khamaaj were played in heavy circulation on the TV and FM stations of Pakistan and India. Fuzon was the first band to release their debut album Saagar concurrently in both Pakistan and India. \"Khamaaj is a very old song and Thumri was composed by the Patiala Gharana, while I composed Saagar.\"[1]\n",
