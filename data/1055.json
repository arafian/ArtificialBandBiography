Their debut album, Take Me Home, was released in 2003, launching the band on a 300-show-a-year tour schedule, split between the U.S. and Europe.  According to the band's tour page, they have opened for or toured with bands such including The Black Eyed Peas, O.A.R. and Rusted Root.\n",

The Wait, in addition to selling 2,700 albums nationwide in its debut week, was also the top selling album in Rhode Island.  The single \"Can't Look Down\" was featured on the 2006 Bionicle Free the Band website, along with songs from the Undertones, Damone, Over It, and others; it also appeared on MTV's The Real World: Key West, \"Road Rules\", and in the ski films Snow Gods and Michael Moore's \"Slacker Uprising\".  \"The Wait\" charted at No. 38 on CMJ charts with 153 Stations adding the disc (Spring 2008).\n"
