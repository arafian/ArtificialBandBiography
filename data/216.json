      "Bearfoot is a post-bluegrass band that was formed in Alaska in 1999 as Bearfoot Bluegrass. The original all-Alaskan band competed in and won the 26th annual Telluride Bluegrass band contest in 2001, and returned the following year to perform in the Telluride Bluegrass Festival. They later changed their name to Bearfoot as their music evolved to include americana, post-bluegrass, and string instrument based pop.\n",
      "They have written many songs, including (also, the writing of) the Alaskan epic Fishtrap Joe, based on one of the historical struggles in Alaska (between locals and Seattle fish empires over fish traps) and the finding of an old skeleton near Cordova by two boys, one of which (Mike Mickelson) later became a founding Bearfoot Bluegrass band member.\n",
      "Before there was Bearfoot Bluegrass, most of the starting line-up met at the Alaska Folk Arts Camp in Anchorage, Alaska. Angela Oudean (vocals, fiddle), Jason Norris (vocals, mandolin), Kate Hamre (acoustic bass), and Annalisa Woodlee (vocals, fiddle) were from Anchorage, and Mike Mickleson (rhythm and lead guitar) was from Cordova, Alaska. Mike's mother, Belle Mickelson, decided to start a music camp in Cordova to encourage her son to practice and play. The others joined Mike there, and when Belle decided to create a camp band, the 4H Fiddle and Dance Camp, also known as the Bluegrass and Old-Time Music and Dance Camp, these five players plus Malani O'Toole (vocals, fiddle, guitar) came together as Bearfoot Bluegrass in 1999. The band started traveling around the state teaching and encouraging music in small rural communities. In February 2001 they recorded their first album Only Time Knows, and then made history in June by becoming the first Alaskan band to win the Telluride Bluegrass band contest, joining the ranks of such reputable artists as Nickel Creek and The Dixie Chicks.\n"
