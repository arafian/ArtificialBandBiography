         "The band is currently composed of all four members of the rock band Clutch (Tim Sult, Dan Maines, Jean-Paul Gaster, Neil Fallon) and has toured extensively throughout Canada and the United States. Taking a sidestep from the traditional Clutch sound, The Bakerton Group focuses on the instrumental talents of its members with songs of a psychedelic, groovy, \"jazz-infected\" feel.[2]\n",
         "The band's first release came in 2001 with the 3-track EP Space Guitars, made available as a free download on the official Clutch website.\n",
         "In August 2006, the band began recording new material for their first full-length release at the Magpie Cage in Baltimore. J. Robbins of Jawbox fame produced the album, which incorporated a new member, Mick Schauer, to play the Hammond organ.[2] On October 2007, over a year after recording began, the eponymous album was released.\n",
         "On February 17, 2009, The Bakerton Group released El Rojo. Also produced by Robbins, it is the band's first release on the Weathermaker Music label. After Schauer left the group in 2007, Per Wiberg of Opeth served as replacement on keyboards, organ, and synthesizers.[2]\n"
