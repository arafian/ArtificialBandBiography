      "Idiot Flesh was an American experimental rock band formed in Oakland, California in 1985, initially working under the name Acid Rain.  Their work was characterized by its \"rock against rock\" slogan, and defied classification with its incorporation of marching band routines, puppet shows, and the playing of household items as tuned instruments.\n",
      "Adopting the Idiot Flesh moniker in 1987, they went on to release three full-length albums before disbanding in 1998.  Founding members Nils Frykdahl and Dan Rathbun later played in Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, while Gene Jun later joined the Sun and Moon Ensemble.\n",
      "The group formed in Barrington Hall, a student co-op at the University of California at Berkeley, in 1985 as Acid Rain. Guitarist and composer Frykdahl (\"Pin\"), bassist Rathbun (\"The Improver\"), and guitarist and violinist Jun (\"Captain Dragon\") formed the group's core lineup, along with early drummers David Shamrock and Daniel Roth. Their demo album We Were All Very Worried was released as a cassette-only edition in 1987. They changed their name to Idiot Flesh prior to the release of their first vinyl album, Tales of Instant Knowledge and Sure Death, in 1990, which also featured drummer/artist Chuck Squier.\n"
