            "In January 2017, the band announced that they were recording their sixth studio album. They released two cover singles shortly after—Sting's \"Shape of My Heart\" in February and Major Lazer's \"Cold Water\" on March 17.[17][18] Instead of working with the same production team in Los Angeles that they had used for their previous four albums, they decided to work with Swedish music producer Martin Terefe, and spent seven weeks recording in London at Terefe's Kensaltown Studios.[19][20] The group announced the name of their upcoming album—Wake Up Call—on July 27, 2017, with the release of its lead single, \"Rx (Medicate)\". The song, which handles the topic of prescription drug addiction, topped the Billboard US Mainstream Rock Songs chart for six consecutive weeks later that year,[21][22] and earned the band a \"No. 1 Song Award\" from the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN).[23]\n",
            "With the release of the new album, the band decided to undergo a name change, shortening it to Theory. The group cited that discussions involving the name of their band with people who are unfamiliar with their music was challenging. Connolly equated it to rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers frequently abbreviating their name to Chili Peppers.[24]\n",
            "Wake Up Call has been described by critics as a departure from Theory of a Deadman's usual hard rock foundation, moving into pop and pop rock territory.[25][26] To promote the album, the band launched a 33-city tour in the United States during the fall of 2017.[27] The tour was extended into 2018 to include shows throughout western Canada and Europe,[19] and the group toured in Australia for the first time in their career in June 2018. Connolly told The Music, \"There’s a real dichotomy of Theory now, two very different sides. Not that we want to get away from our old songs, but the new songs are so diverse, such a juxtaposition. We're really working on building a big show, and trying to make it all more visual, as well.\"[28]\n"

It was released simultaneously with an official animated music video.[33]\n",
