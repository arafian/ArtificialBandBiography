      "La Excepción que Confirma la Regla (The Exception That Proves The Rule; often shortened to La Excepción) is a rap band from Madrid, composed of two MCs: El Langui (Juan Manuel Montilla) and Gitano Antón (Antonio Moreno), and DJ La dako style (Javier Ibañez).\n",
      "They started a small revolution in the Spanish hip-hop scene, opening new doors with a very self-assured and personal style that integrates flamenco, Cheli slang, and a lot of  humor, without losing the social critique so central to hip-hop. They have made, from a very local identity, a universal rap that has become popular around the whole country and has achieved rankings not normally held by hip-hop. They won Best Disc of the Year in Rolling Stone Magazine for their first work “”Cata Cheli”” and Best New Group from PEMOC (Group of Musical Journalists)please cite the source information.\n",
      "They have known each other since childhood, and began testing the waters with the rest of their friends in “”Amenaza Criminal””, in a totally amateur way. With time, only the actual members of the group continued in the world of hip-hop, completing the formation of La Excepción. They discovered they could make rap using their own gypsy slang and they continued to polish their style in small concerts. In one of these they met the ubiquitous MC and producer Frank T, who decided to speed their journey, making first their single “En tu carro paio!” (2002) and then their first record, “”Cata Cheli””, as well as interpreting with them the song \"El negro, el cojo y el gitano\". In addition to the basis provided by Frank T, they relied upon the Frenchman, Super Jeff Dominguez to mix their first CD. Their success among critics and sales has led them to act in the main festivals of the country, like Viña Rock, the Monegros Desert Festival or the Urban Culture de Madrid. All this brought about the re-release of the disc with a DVD and two new tracks.\n"
