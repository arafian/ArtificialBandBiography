         "The Whoreshoes was an all-female, honky tonk/bluegrass/country band based in the San Francisco Bay area.  The group's name is primarily a pun based on horseshoes. They have played internationally in countries such as Belgium and The Netherlands.[1]  In addition they performed at the 2007 Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival is San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. On February 12, 2009, they gave their final show and have since gone their separate ways.\n",
         "They like whiskey, particularly Jameson or American Bourbon.  Insiders tip: the more whiskey they are given, the longer they play.\n",
         "The Whoreshoes main influences include country legends Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, The Carter Family, Stanley Brothers, Louvin Brothers, Doc Boggs, and alternative country acts such as Hank III, Meat Purveyors, Old Crow Medicine Show, and Lucinda Williams.\n"
