      "Econoline Crush is a Canadian rock band from Vancouver, British Columbia, formed in 1992. They have released five studio albums and are known for their charting singles such as \"You Don't Know What It's Like\", \"Home\", \"Surefire (Never Enough)\", \"All That You Are (X3)\", \"Make It Right\", and \"Dirty\". They achieved platinum status with the 1997 album The Devil You Know and also received two Juno nominations, in 1995 and 1998.\n",
      "Econoline Crush was formed in 1992 when singer Trevor Hurst moved to Vancouver from Seattle after he answered an ad seeking a vocalist in the local Seattle newspaper, The Rocket, placed by Chris Meyers. Tom Ferris (previously known for the band Moev) and Meyers had been advertising and searching for a vocalist before Hurst contacted Meyers from Seattle. The trio began writing demos and shortly thereafter, the band started to receive fan and music industry attention. Guitarist Robbie Morfitt, guitarist Hack, bassist Dan Yaremko, and drummer Gregg Leask had rounded out the lineup. In 1993, Ferris (whom had songwriting credits on the next two releases) and Meyers had left the band, and Econoline Crush signed a record deal with EMI Music Canada, after playing only 26 shows total.\n",
      "In 1994, the band released their first EP called Purge, with producer Dale Penner (later famous for Nickelback) and keyboardist/programmer Rhys Fulber. \"T.D.M.\" was the only song to be released as a single, and its music video aired sporadically on the television program MuchOnDemand. In 1995, the band gained their first nomination for a Juno Award in Canada due to Purge.\n"
