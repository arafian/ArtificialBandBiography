      "\nThe Piranhas were a British ska-influenced punk band from Brighton. They are best known for their cover version of the song \"Tom Hark\".\n",
      "The Piranhas formed in 1977, and were originally part of the Brighton punk scene, first coming  to prominence when DJ John Peel started playing their single \"I Don't Want My Body\" on his BBC Radio 1 programme, but achieved their biggest success with their cover version of the South African kwela song \"Tom Hark\". This had been an instrumental hit in 1958 for Elias & His Zig Zag Jive Flutes, and had already been covered in a ska style by Millie Small and by Georgie Fame on his 1964 EP \"Rhythm & Blue-Beat\".  With new lyrics written by the band's frontman \"Boring\" Bob Grover (allegedly en route to the recording studio), and with Pete Waterman on executive production duties, it was a Top 10 hit in the UK Singles Chart in 1980.\nIt was the first song to feature on BBC Television's pop music programme, Top of the Pops, when it returned in 1980 after being blacked out for nine weeks by industrial action. During the obviously mimed performance the drummer played using a pair of plastic fish as drumsticks.\n",
      "Much later it also became a popular chant amongst British football fans.  It is also popular at limited-overs cricket games, often being played when a boundary is hit, and the tune was also used in the novelty World Cup song \"We're England\", performed by the presenters of the radio station talkSPORT with adapted lyrics for the 2006 FIFA World Cup Finals. Two years later the band's version of Lou Busch's \"Zambesi\" - produced by Pete Collins - was a Top 20 hit in the UK Singles Chart.\n"
