      "The Blue Shadows were a Juno Award-nominated Canadian alt-country band that existed between 1992 and 1996, releasing two albums in Canada on Sony Music.\n",
      "The origins of the group are referenced to Billy Cowsill and Elmar Spanier, who had been performing as The Billy Cowsill Band, playing traditional country songs.\n",
      "The settled initial group formation was Jeffrey Hatcher and Billy Cowsill as guitarists and principal songwriters, plus bassist Elmer Spanier and drummer J.B. \"Jay\" Johnson. Spanier left the band in 1993, prior to the release of their first album, and was replaced by Barry Muir, who had previously worked with Barney Bentall and The Payolas.  The name of the group, suggested by Hatcher's wife, was based on the song \"Blue Shadows On The Trail\" by Sons of the Pioneers.\n"
