      "Sputniks Down are a Scottish band. Signed to Edinburgh's Human Condition Records, Sputniks Down (named after a song by Lou Barlow's Folk Implosion) were a three piece from Bishopbriggs on the outskirts of Glasgow. They produced instrumental electronica with 'Eno-esque gorgeousness'. 'The Young Marble Giants stepping out with a prozac-ed up Godspeed You! Black Emperor while the Mary Chain bite their ankles'. Influences also included such bands as Tortoise and Mogwai.\n",
      "They were one of the first bands from the UK (along with fellow Glaswegians Mogwai) to play instrumental, post-rock and subsequently formed an important part of the early 2000s Glasgow music scene.\n",
      "After a handful of gigs, they were signed to Edinburgh's Human Condition record label. In January 2000, their debut EP Monotone Mountain was recorded by Tony Doogan at CaVa Studios. At the time, they were highly thought of by Keith Cameron (NME), Roy Wilkinson (Select) and Vic Galloway (BBC Radio 1 Evening Session). 'MM' was described as 'an electropopguitary lullaby'. The EP was released on 17 April 2000. The gig to celebrate the EP launch on 27 April 2000 in Avalanche, Edinburgh was reviewed by the NME.\n"
