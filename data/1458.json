      "The Clan MacRae Society Pipe Band was a pipe band based in Glasgow. \n",
      "The civilian City of Glasgow Pipe Band was established by Farquhar MacRae in January 1914, who had previously led the pipe band of the 7th (Blythswood) Battalion Highland Light Infantry, a reserve battalion. The pipe band of the 7th Battalion won the World Pipe Band Championships in 1913, and MacRae resigned along with much of his band after the annual camp of 1913. The first time the City of Glasgow Pipe Band entered the World Championships in 1914 it won second place.\n",
      "When World War I broke out the band was disbanded, but was reformed under the leadership of William Fergusson in 1920. MacRae died in 1916, and the name of the band was changed to the Clan MacRae Society Pipe Band at some point in the 1920s. At one point under Ferguson's leadership, the band contained six qualified Pipe majors.\n"
