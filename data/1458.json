         "The civilian City of Glasgow Pipe Band was established by Farquhar MacRae in January 1914, who had previously led the pipe band of the 7th (Blythswood) Battalion Highland Light Infantry, a reserve battalion.[1] The pipe band of the 7th Battalion won the World Pipe Band Championships in 1913, and MacRae resigned along with much of his band after the annual camp of 1913.[1] The first time the City of Glasgow Pipe Band entered the World Championships in 1914 it won second place.[2][1]\n",
         "When World War I broke out the band was disbanded, but was reformed under the leadership of William Fergusson in 1920.[1] MacRae died in 1916, and the name of the band was changed to the Clan MacRae Society Pipe Band at some point in the 1920s.[2] At one point under Ferguson's leadership, the band contained six qualified Pipe majors.[2]\n",
         "William Fergusson led the band to victory at the World Championships in 1921, 1922, 1923 and 1925.[3] Ferguson was a prolific composer, and wrote tunes such as the 2/4 marches \"Clan MacRae Society Pipe Band\" and \"The Atholl and Breadalbane Gathering.\"[3]\n",
         "After Ferguson was injured in an accident, Hamish McColl, a longstanding member of the band, took over as pipe major.[1] After 18 months, McColl was succeeded by John Findlay Nicoll, who led the band to first place at the Worlds in 1932, 1933 and 1934.[1]\n",
         "Nicoll resigned due to ill-health in 1950 and was succeeded by Alexander Macleod, a pupil of Ferguson.[1] The band under Macleod won the World Championships again in 1953.\n",
         "The band was downgraded to Grade 2, but won the Grade 2 World Championships under Pipe Major John Finlay.[4]\n"
