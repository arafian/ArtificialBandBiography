      "The Godz are an American hard rock band from Columbus, Ohio, United States, that formed in 1976.\n",
      "Formed in 1976, the band conceived their moniker only to later learn of a band from New York City already known as the Godz. A monetary settlement allowed them to keep their name. The Godz did not have a recording contract when they hit the road with Kiss alongside Cheap Trick in 1977. The band released its debut album, The Godz, the next year on Millennium Records. In addition to being on the Kiss Love Gun tour, they played on what was billed as the \"Heaven and Hell Tour\" by embarking on the road with Angel. \"Godz are macho, mean biker boys,\" wrote Sylvie Simmons in 1978. \"Their songs are about dope and bikes and rock and sex. They're loud, brash, crude, but a bloody good rock band.\"\n",
      "In 1979, band's original label, Millennium Records, changed its distribution from Casablanca Records to RCA Records and the Millennium label was subsequently folded altogether. Millennium's parent label, Casablanca Records, picked up the Godz to fulfill their contractual obligation with the band but had no particular enthusiasm for them when their second album, Nothing is Sacred, was released the same year.\n"
