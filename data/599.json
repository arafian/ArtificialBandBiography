         "Baxter met Sbragia after a Softies show, when Baxter gave Sbragia a tape of her music. That summer, Baxter asked each of the girls if they wanted to start an \"all girl summer fun band.\" Although the other three hadn't met before, they all agreed, and the band was formed.[2] After releasing an EP and several singles, they joined K Records. K released two albums for the band, an eponymous debut and the follow-up 2, before Douangpanya left the band in 2005 to raise her son. The remaining members continued as a three-piece. On September 23, 2008, the band released their third full-length album.\n",
