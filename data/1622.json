      "La Polla Records is a punk rock band from the  Basque Country, formed in 1979 in Salvatierra/Agurain, a small town in Álava, Spain. Its founders were Evaristo Páramos|Evaristo on vocals, Maleguin on bass, Fernandito on drums and Txarly and Sumé on guitars. The name was somewhat controversial because in Spanish, \"polla\" is vulgarly slang for \"cock, penis\". The lyrics of the band harshly criticized fascism, militarism, capitalism, and catholicism. La Polla Records has been very influential in the Spanish-language punk scene.\n",
      "La Polla Records was a band that was known as a symbol of rebellion against everything, to the point of them being called \"anti-everything\". As a result of this they faced several major obstacles throughout their career, primarily threats and repression. The band members even faced jail time during a concert with Eskorbuto, another Spanish punk band. In 2019, they announced a comeback and released an album after 16 years off-stage as a band.\n",
      "On 9 December 1979, inspired by the British punk movement, La Polla Records did their first gig at the only pub from Salvatierra, with all the town's people at the show, in words of Evaristo: \"to see what the fools of the village made\".\n"
