         "After Álvaro, a former soccer player for teams such as Getafe CF and Real Madrid, suffered a serious injury, he began to play guitar and compose songs during his rehabilitation period. He finally quit football and created a band called PIG NOISE. The group later used many of the songs he composed while in rehabilitation. Later Polo, another former soccer player for Real Zaragoza and other teams, joined the group. The last to join was Pablo, a student who had come from Asturias to Madrid to study theater. Their popularity increased sharply after appearing in a very well known Spanish show, Los hombres de Paco.\n",
         "During the elections in the Basque Autonomous Community the band played in a meeting created by the conservative Spanish political party Partido Popular.[1] The band has been heavily criticized after that, but during an interview for 20minutos.es, the bandmembers said that they thought it was just an event for young people created by Partido Popular and concluded saying that they'll never play in a political meeting again.[2]\n"

Even though they have been seen wearing NOFX shirts in music videos, their light punk rock characteristics and their predominant pop music sound makes them clearly a pop punk band. They may also be considered pop rock or alternative rock. The band cites Ramones, blink-182, Green Day, NoFX, Slick Shoes, Allister and The Offspring as some of their main influences.\n"
