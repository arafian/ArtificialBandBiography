            "The band's later releases moved towards a heavy metal sound, including a cover of Van Halen's \"On Fire\". The more advanced musical and lyrical development on Black Daze brought Wasted Youth to new thrash metal audiences. The video for the album's \"Good Day For a Hanging\" depicts a motorcycle spinning amongst concert-goers in a mud-pit.\n"

            "Jeff Dahlgren, front man after Allah Akhbar (1983â€“1985), left the band. His work was re-recorded by Paolo Rossi co-produced with Darin Scheff and titled \"Get out of My Yard\".  Paolo Rossi (the last generation of Wasted Youth front men) went on to start an indie label \"Open Circle Records\" in Glendale, California (Open Circle released Get Out of My Yard LP). Wasted Youth led a successful \"Crack Across America Tour\" in the late 1980s to support \"Get Out of My Yard.\" Michael Licalsi, a club and show promoter from the SF Bay Area, served as their manager, with Louis (VideoLouis) Elovitz taking part in management for a period of time as well. Wasted Youth performed with bands such as Bad Brains, The Ramones, and Circle Jerks on this final tour.\n"
