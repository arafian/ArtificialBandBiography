      "Drain STH (STH for Stockholm) was a rock band from Sweden.\n",
      "Stockholm quartet Drain STH underwent many changes in both musical style and image. Guitarist Flavia Canel and drummer Martina Axén had been together in many acts starting with punk band Livin' Sacrifice (not to be confused with the thrash metal band Living Sacrifice). As this act progressed the sound developed into more of a hard rock vein.\n",
      "Livin' Sacrifice evolved into Aphrodite with Axén, Canel, vocalist Malin Ekholm, guitarist Maria \"Mia\" Landberg, and bassist Marianne Hall. Aphrodite folded upon Ekholm's departure in 1990.\n"
