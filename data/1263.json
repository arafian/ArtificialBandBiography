      "Quetzal is a bilingual (Spanish-English) Chicano rock band from East Los Angeles, California.\n",
      "The band was founded by Quetzal Flores, with the intention of pushing the boundaries of Chicano music and is currently one of Los Angeles' most important and successful groups. They play a mix of Mexican and Afro-Cuban rhythms, jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock music, supercharged by the dynamic vocals of lead singer and composer Martha Gonzalez. Their commitment to using art as a tool for social change is informed and inspired by global grassroots movements. They have also been instrumental in developing Fandango Sin Fronteras, a dialog between Chicanos and Chicanas from California and Jarocho and Jarocha (musicians from Veracruz, Mexico). The band began in 1993 in a Chicano owned cafe, Troy cafe, in the Little Tokyo neighborhood of Los Angeles. Martha Gonzalez joined the group in 1995  They helped catalyze the Seattle Fandango Project in 2009 when Martha Gonzalez moved to Seattle to complete her PhD in Gender, Women & Sexuality Studies from the University of Washington. Martha's research on the transnational music movement across the Americas and Europe, with a special focus for innovations of women in the music and dance of son Jarocho awarded her a Fulbright-Garcia Robles Award and a Ford Foundation Dissertation Fellowship. Martha released her Fulbright research project Entre Mujeres:Feminine Translocal Music Composition, as a CD compilation. Martha Gonzalez who was born and raised in East Los Angeles joined the group shortly after it was formed.  Gonzalez grew up singing and learning the sentiment of Mexican music with her two siblings.  Encouraged by their father, the youthful trio sang with mariachi ensembles in the greater Los Angeles area.  Gonzalez completed her PhD in the Department of Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies at the University of Washington and as an undergraduate studied drumming and dance of Ghana and Cuba at UCLA.  Her musical background gave her a solid foundation to contribute as a performer, lyricist, and composer.  She affirms a strong female perspective in the group’s creative projects.  In her words, “part of being in the band is having a Chicana feminist analysis. The presence of women in the group is not ‘eye candy’ or a tokenized gesture toward balancing any sort of gender scale:  it’s an honest recognition of the poetic, musical, and compositional strengths the female musicians in the community possess.” A fan of old school artists, Martha cites some of her biggest influences in music are Chaka Khan, Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight and Joni Mitchell.\n",
      "Quetzal is an ensemble of highly talented musicians, joined for the goal of creating good music that tells the social, cultural, political, and musical stories of  people in struggle.  Martha Gonzalez (lead singer, percussionist, and songwriter) calls it an “East LA Chican@ rock group,” summing up its rootedness in the complex cultural currents of life in the barrio, its social activism, its strong feminist stance, and its rock and roll musical beginnings.  Besides being a rock band, the group and its members participate in a much larger web of musical, cultural, and political engagement.\n"
