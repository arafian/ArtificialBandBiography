      "The Users were an English punk rock band, formed in Cambridge, England, that was active between 1977 and 1979.\n",
      "In 1977, Cambridge record dealer Lee Wood founded Raw Records, and quickly recorded The Users in March of the year, releasing the single \"Sick of You\" / \"(I'm) In Love With Today\" on May 5, 1977.  Sounds magazine stated that it \"burns into your brain without compromise.\"\n",
      "Despite only releasing two singles and being active for less than three years, the band developed a lasting cult following. BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel placed their first single \"Sick of You\" in his chosen Festive Fifty chart of 1977, and after his death it was revealed that he'd kept it as part of his favourite singles of all time.  The single was later reissued in 1999 and 2006 by Damaged Goods.\n"
