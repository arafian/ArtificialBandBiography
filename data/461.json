   "Name": "Luna Halo",
   "rawData": [
      "Luna Halo was a rock band formed in 1999 by Nathan Barlowe and Jonny MacIntosh, as a replacement for their former band, Reality Check, which was known for its hip-hop and rock blend, its dancers, and its trumpet player.\n",
      "In 2000, Luna Halo was fronted by former Reality Check front man Nathan Barlowe and released their debut CD Shimmer on Christian music label Sparrow Records. Even though Shimmer was praised by critics and they booked many church gigs, Luna Halo left Sparrow Records and the Christian music industry before recording their next album due to creative differences. Macintosh was a worship leader at his father's megachurch Horizon Christian Fellowship in San Diego, California.\n",
      "The final version of Luna Halo contained different members from earlier versions, and although several of the band members claim to be Christians, they say they left the \"Christian band\" moniker behind.\n"
