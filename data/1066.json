      "Heedoosh (Hebrew: חידוש‎; \"revelation\") is an Israeli-American Jewish hard rock band from New York City. They were formed in 2005 by brothers Yaniv and Yahav Tsaidi, and released their debut album, Meumkah Delibah (\"Depth of the Heart\"), in 2006.\n",
      "Heedoosh was founded by brothers Yaniv and Yahav Tsaidi, who were born in Israel but grew up in Detroit with Yemenite-Moroccan parents. Yaniv began his career as a Hasidic pop singer in Chicago, recording two solo albums and performing on the 2004 Am Yisrael Chai tour alongside Reva L'Sheva and Adi Ran; eventually, however, he decided to take his music in a rock direction.\n",
      "The Tsaidis formed Heedoosh in New York City in 2005, collaborating with Brooklyn-based producer/guitarist Eli Massias and drummer Ari Leichtberg. That same year, they performed at the Triad Theater, played the Jewish music festival Yidstock at Monticello Raceway, and opened for Badfish.\n"
