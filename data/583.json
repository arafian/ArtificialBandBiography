      "text": [
         "Sculptured's unusual style is particularly evident on the first track of Apollo Ends,[2] \"Washing My Hands of It\", while the track \"Snow Covers All\" uses a form of serialism, while \"Above the 60th Parallel\" features a Twelve-tone technique solo. The band also introduces classical orchestrations in some of its pieces.\n",
         "The history and fate of Sculptured is inherently related to Agalloch because of Don Anderson's significant involvement with both bands. Because of this, Sculptured left The End Records at the same time as Agalloch.\n"
