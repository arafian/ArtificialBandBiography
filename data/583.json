         "Sculptured's unusual style is particularly evident on the first track of Apollo Ends,[2] \"Washing My Hands of It\", while the track \"Snow Covers All\" uses a form of serialism, while \"Above the 60th Parallel\" features a Twelve-tone technique solo. The band also introduces classical orchestrations in some of its pieces.\n",
