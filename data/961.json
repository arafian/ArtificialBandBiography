      "EOTO (/ˈiːoʊtoʊ/ EE-oh-toh) is an electronic band consisting of Michael Travis and Jason Hann.\n",
      "The band's music is created live and without prerecorded loops.\nThe band formed in 2006 as a side project of The String Cheese Incident incorporating looper pedals, like Echoplex and the production program Ableton. According to one reviewer, the duo sets their live instruments free and take on a new electronic flavor.\n",

In 2008 they played over 200 live shows  and more than seven hundred shows in 48 different states during the five years since their founding.
