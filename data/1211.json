   "History": {

         "Ima Robot formed in the late 1990s. In the early 2000s, the band signed with Virgin Records. The band's other original members were Timmy \"The Terror\" Anderson, Oliver \"Oligee\" Goldstein, Justin Meldal-Johnsen, and studio drummer Joey Waronker. Meldal-Johnsen and Waronker were sought-after musicians who had played with Beck before joining Ima Robot.\n",
         "On September 16, 2003, Ima Robot released their first full-length album, the self-titled Ima Robot. The album featured the singles \"Dynomite\" and \"Song #1\" (released in the UK only).\n",
         "In 2004, Waronker and \"Oligee\" left the band. Meldal-Johnsen followed in 2005, with former Oleander drummer Scott Devours. Tim Anderson's cousin, whom he had never met before Devours, auditioned and took over the drums. Filip Nikolic took over the bass and Andy Marlow started playing the keyboards.\n",
         "On September 12, 2006, they released their second album Monument to the Masses, which featured the singles \"Creeps Me Out\" and \"Lovers in Captivity\".\n",
         "In April 2007, the band won their independence from Virgin Records and continued to work unsigned under the management of Alexis Rivera of Echo Park Records. The song \"Gangster\" premiered on the band's MySpace on April 15, 2008, with its lyrics posted in a blog entry by the band.[2] In 2010 the band announced the upcoming release of their new album, Another Man's Treasure, and released the song \"Ruthless\" on the Internet.\n",
         "Ebert remained frustrated with Virgin, saying in a 2016 interview with Transverso Media that, \"pretty unironically I ended up feeling like a robot by the end of the process because of the major label thing.\"[3] During that period, they were being represented by the Werewolf Heart label.[4]\n",
         "In June 2008, Lars Vognstrup joined the group, having previously played with Nikolic in the band Junior Senior. In 2009, Orpheo McCord (of Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros and of Fool's Gold), Jason \"ComputerJay\" Taylor, and Jonas Petri Megyessi joined the band.\n",
         "On January 6, 2011, the band played six songs live on KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic. This was the first time since Monument to the Masses tours that the new band lineup had played live. Ima Robot's B-side \"Greenback Boogie\" from the album Another Man's Treasure has been featured as the theme song of the USA Network legal drama, Suits, since 2011.\n",
         "The band has been inactive since 2011 as its members have been busy with side projects. Alex Ebert has stated that he is \"still in Ima Robot.\"[5]\n"
