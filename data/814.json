      "Their music can be described as a fusion of psychedelic rock and raw Stooges-esque rock 'n' roll—and a bit angrier than The Soundtrack of Our Lives (the band that emerged from the ashes of Union Carbide Productions).\n",
      "Though never really commercially successful, the band has received praise from artists like Kurt Cobain, R.E.M. and Sonic Youth. After the success of The Soundtrack of Our Lives, a compilation CD was released in 2004.\n"
