            "Phantom Blue was formed in 1988 in Hollywood, California by Michelle Meldrum and Nicole Couch. Couch and Meldrum were students of Paul Gilbert and Bruce Bouillet of Racer X.[1][failed verification] Michelle Meldrum had played with drummer Linda McDonald in previous projects and together with vocalist Gigi Hangach and original bassist, Debra Armstrong. Armstrong left the band in June 1988, prior to the band signing with Shrapnel Records, in October 1988, and was replaced by Kim Nielsen, a student of John Alderete, bassist for Racer X and The Mars Volta.[1] Phantom Blue recorded their self-titled first album with the help of producer Steve Fontano and fellow Shrapnel label mate, Marty Friedman.[2] Couch and Meldrum also co-wrote a track on the album with Marty Freidman.[1] Roadrunner Records, who owned the bands European distribution rights, were responsible for the band shooting a video for the single \"Why Call It Love?\" and a successful European tour followed.\n",
            "Upon returning to the States, Phantom Blue caught the attention of singer Don Dokken who introduced them to Tom Zutaut of Geffen Records. Other major labels were interested in signing the band, most notably Disney's Hollywood Records, but the band signed with Geffen. Couch and Meldrum began writing the material for the Geffen release. Couch left the band prior to recording and Meldrum successfully recorded all the guitar parts for Built to Perform.[2] Guitarist Karen Kreutzer replaced Couch and the band embarked on another successful European tour and shot a video for the single \"Time to Run\".\n",
            "The band was eventually dropped from Geffen, sued by manager Byron Hontas and the management position was taken over by Mark Dawson, boyfriend of drummer Linda McDonald. Guitarist Michelle Meldrum was the first to leave due to disagreement as to the direction of the band under Dawson and vocalist Gigi Hangach soon followed. By 1996, McDonald was the only original member left and she continued to use the name Phantom Blue, enlisting a total of ten different members until finally calling it quits in early 2001.\n"
