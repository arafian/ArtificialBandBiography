         "The Unlovables are a New York City based pop punk band.  The band formed after bassist/singer Hallie Bulleit recorded a handful of songs for a present with Adam Rabuck (of Dirt Bike Annie) who encouraged her to continue playing music.  Despite a somewhat revolving lineup, the band has remained fairly active over the years, including recording and releasing two full-length records on Whoa Oh Records as well as EP's and other compilation appearances, and tours often, not including other shows with mc chris,[1] as well as the recently reunited Lifetime.[2] and Weston[3] The band became more mainstream after Adult Swim used the song \"What you want, what you got\" in a 30-second Bleach Promo. The band is currently taking a long hiatus while Hallie performs in the off-Broadway show FUERZABRUTA.[4]\n"
