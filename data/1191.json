They were the first band announced for the tour.[11] On March 23, 2016, Chris Davis, formerly of Texas in July, was announced as an official member after touring with the band since 2015.[12] On February 10, 2017, Vigil announced that the band would be unable to perform on Warped Tour 2017. Warped Tour announced they would continue to hold their spot for the band until they were well enough to play, even though the Warped Tour's full cross-country format was retired the following year.\n",

            "The show at The Shrine sold out in 4 minutes according to vocalist Jonathan Vigil. The show successfully took place on July 13, outside the venue with a festival-style stage rather than in the expo hall itself. During the show, Vigil said he wasn't sure if that would be The Ghost Inside's last show ever or if they'd play \"a hundred more,\" but he did announce that the band was working on new music.[16]\n",

         "The Ghost Inside's music has been classified as metalcore[22] and \"melodic, emotional hardcore\".[23] They have self-identified as melodic hardcore, for example on their Facebook page. However, former bassist and backing vocalist Jim Riley stated in a 2013 interview that \"to [him] the band is a metalcore band\" and that they're \"similar to Unearth or As I Lay Dying or something like that, with a little bit less guitar solos and a little bit less singing\".[22] He said that they are influenced by \"an older generation of bands\" such as Throwdown, Bury Your Dead (especially Beauty and the Breakdown), Misery Signals, Killswitch Engage, Unearth (especially The Oncoming Storm) and Bleeding Through, some of which he considers \"seminal to what metalcore is\", as well as modern music that isn't necessarily heavy (such as pop punk), and that he himself listens \"to a lot of emo\".[22] In a 2009 interview, vocalist Jonathan Vigil stated that he grew up listening to punk rock bands such as NOFX and Less Than Jake before getting into heavier bands such as Hatebreed and Slipknot, while guitarist Aaron Brooks said that he listened to bands like Bad Religion before getting into Poison the Well, that one of his favorite bands currently are Comeback Kid and that he also appreciates Hatebreed.[24] This musical background was further confirmed when Zach Johnson listed NOFX's Punk in Drublic, Strung Out's Suburban Teenage Wasteland Blues and AFI's Black Sails in the Sunset as his favorite three albums.[25]\n",
         "Riley stated that when writing a song, the band usually puts the instrumentation together first, before vocalist Jonathan Vigil and guitarist Aaron Brooks write lyrics for it. He also noted that the decision to use clean vocals in some songs of Get What You Give, such as \"Engine 45\", came from the band and wasn't forced by producer Jeremy McKinnon.[22]\n"
