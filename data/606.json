         "The Applicators are an American pop punk band. Their music is influenced by classic punk bands such as The Misfits and The Cramps, as well as Mot√∂rhead. They formed in January 1999 in Austin, Texas with an all-female lineup: lead vocalist Sabrina, Erica on guitar, Rachel on bass and Katy on drums.[1][2] The Applicators have toured nationally with Teen Idols, Fear, and Bad Religion. Bad Religion guitarist Greg Hetson produced their debut album after seeing one of their gigs in Texas while on tour.[3]\n"
