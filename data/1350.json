         "The band received its earliest recognition in the mid-1990s by touring with My Dying Bride, Tiamat and Atrocity.[1] Much like the latter two groups, the band had begun as traditional death metal, then evolved in an industrial music and gothic metal musical direction on later albums. The band received heavy rotation on MTV Germany,[2] and made appearances at various extreme metal festivals, including Germany's Wacken Open Air in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2008, in addition to inclusion on Nuclear Blast compilation samplers.\n",
         "The band re-signed to Massacre Records in 2006 after a 10-year stint with Nuclear Blast; Massacre had been the band's first label. In 2013 they signed with Steamhammer/SPV[3] to release their next album, Antiserum. In 2019 they moved to Napalm Records,[4] and their 15th studio album, Unbroken, will be released under their label, on 6 March 2020.[5]\n",
         "Active for over 20 years (with a brief split between 2001 and 2003) they are among one of Europe's longest running gothic metal bands.[1]\n"
