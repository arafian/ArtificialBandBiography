         "They performed a live score to the silent film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin. Film-scoring work includes the Richard Linklater film Fast Food Nation and the John Waters narrated feature documentary Plagues & Pleasures on the Salton Sea.[4]\n",
         "Upon seeing Plagues & Pleasures on the Salton Sea for the first time, Elm recollects, \"I felt I could really write music for this. It was a nice fit for what we do, the images, and the story.  It felt natural to watch it and want to write music.  It was inspiring, and that's the most you can ask for when you score something or write music.\"[5]\n",
         "In December 2010, Elm and Jackson won Best Original Score at both the Machinima Inside Gaming Awards and Spike TV's Video Game Awards for their work on Red Dead Redemption.[6][7]\n"
