With The Clash grabbing all attention of Epic's marketing combined with poor management, Masterswitch split in 1978.[4]\n",

Following a lengthy period of illness, Ray Simone died on 18 June 2012. In 2013, following Simone's death, Lee and Sumeray decided to resurrect Woodfog. They recruited Paul Squires on drums. Edwards died in January 2015.[5]\n",
