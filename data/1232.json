   "History": {
      "text": [
         "Medicine was formed by ex-Savage Republic drummer Brad Laner,[2] based on some 4-track recordings Laner was working on in 1990. After playing the tapes for music industry representatives, he was told that if he formed a band that sounded like the tapes, he could get a record deal. Laner then assembled a band of musicians from the Los Angeles music scene. Medicine's early lineup included Laner, drummer Jim Goodall (Severed Head in a Bag, Jon Wayne, Lopez Beatles), guitarist Jim Putnam, bassist Eddie Ruscha and singer Annette Zilinskas (an original member of the Bangles). Zilinskas left before any official releases and was replaced by former Fourwaycross singer Beth Thompson. On the basis of the original demo, the band were signed to Creation Records, becoming the first American band to do so. In America, Medicine signed to Rick Rubin's American Recordings label in 1992. With a signature guitar tone, created by running Laner's guitar through a Yamaha 4-track recorder, Medicine's music managed to distinguish itself from some of the more ambiguous endeavors of the shoegaze movement.\n",
         "Their first album, Shot Forth Self Living, was released in 1992. It received airplay on college radio and coverage in alternative newspapers, with even a few of their videos played on MTV.\n",
         "Their second album, The Buried Life, was released the following year, and gained Medicine more mainstream attention, including coverage in magazines like Creem.  \n",
         "For their third album, Her Highness (1995), Matt Devine and Justin Meldal-Johnsen replaced Putnam and Ruscha, respectively. The band broke up soon after, and Laner formed supergroup Lusk.\n",
         "Medicine reformed briefly in 2003, solely as a duo including Laner and Shannon Lee, the daughter of actor Bruce Lee. They released one album, The Mechanical Forces of Love.\n",
         "The band's core lineup of Laner, Thompson and Goodall later reformed again and signed with the Captured Tracks label. Medicine released a new studio album, To the Happy Few, in July 2013, preceded by the single \"Long as the Sun\". On October 27, 2014, they released their sixth studio album, Home Everywhere.\n",
         "2019 album Scarred for Life[3] featured Laner,Zilinskas,and Devine.[4]\n"

         "Pitchfork has hailed Medicine as the closest thing to being an American answer to My Bloody Valentine.[5]\n",
