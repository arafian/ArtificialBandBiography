Lyrically, the group tended towards satirical commentary on the hardcore punk scene. The group has been described as a \"fast, screaming mess of tall, skinny guys with a lot to say (which you would only know if you read the liner notes)\".[2] The group was sometimes criticized for its conceptual take on hardcore and art school tendencies, maintaining a long-standing feud with Felix Havoc of Code 13.[3]\n"
