         "The band formed in 1995 under the name Psychodrama by three sisters, guitarist Gel, bassist Lisa, and singer Laura Baca. The three auditioned both male and female drummers, but couldn’t find one suitable for their planned style of music. Laura began experimenting with the drum set they had been using for auditions, and soon picked up the drumbeat despite never having played the instrument. About halfway through the rendition of the song, she started to sing along. The sisters stopped auditioning and  Laura became both lead vocalist and drummer.\n",
         "The band played their first show under the name Psychodrama and released a single, \"Vivid\".  In 1996 the sisters changed their band name to The Eyeliners while touring the west coast, as more appropriate for their musical style.\n",
         "Under their new name, the group has released EPs on Sympathy for the Record Industry followed by albums on Lookout Records in 2000 and 2001.[1]  The 2005 album No Apologies (Blackheart Records) includes a cover of When in Rome's 1988 song \"The Promise.\"[2]\n",
         "A few months later, The Eyeliners played a show with the Red Aunts. Red Aunts frontwoman, Terri Wahl,  introduced them to owner of Sympathy For the Record Industry, Long Gone John. Soon, the Eyeliners debut CD and 7” were released. Two more seven inches (“Do The Zombie” and “Rock N Roll, Baby”) followed on Sympathy for the Record Industry over the next couple of years.\n"
