         "According to vocalist Ernie Sorrentino, he was asked to provide a lead vocal for the Lanny Lambert and Bobby Flax song, \"White Lies, Blue Eyes,\" which had been recorded with studio instrumentalists some weeks before with Flax and Lambert singing harmony vocals. The producers, satisfied with the result, asked Sorrentino to record \"Changes of Mind\" for the B side, a song that he and drummer Mike Micara had written for their current band. The record was released on the Big Tree Records label under the name \"Bullet\" in December 1971. As \"White Lies\" quickly ran up the charts, guitarist Paul Granato was recruited along with keyboard/trumpet player Roget Pontbriand, and other members of the New York band Riverside Drive, to fill out a touring band. Pontbriand relates that \"a booking agent named John Apostle was asked to put a band together. At that time, I had been playing with Joey Stann and the late George Ruiz at an upper-Manhattan club called Churchill's Plum. John knew us and asked us to be part of Bullet along with Sorrentino and a drummer named Mike Micara. ... We shot the promotional photos for Bullet in Central Park the day after we met Ernie.\"[1] The new band appeared on American Bandstand on March 11, 1972 performing \"White Lies\" and \"Willpower Weak, Temptation Strong.\"\n"
