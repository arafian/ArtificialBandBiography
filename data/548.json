      "The Hard Rubber Orchestra is a jazz band led by composer and trumpeter John Korsrud in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Founded in 1990, it has a shifting membership of 15-30 musicians. It is known for spotlighting work by contemporary composers and won the Alcan Performing Arts Award in 2004.\n",
      "The Hard Rubber Orchestra was founded in 1990 by John Korsrud.  It had instrumentation similar to a big band, but the music was \"an unholy mashup of minimalism, free jazz, noise, and funk\".\n",
      "In 1992, a non-profit \"Hard Rubber Music Society\" was created as a vehicle for funding the orchestra. It operates with a mix of private donations, city funding, and Canada Council grants.\n"
