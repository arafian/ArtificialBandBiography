      "\nChic Chocolate (1916 – May 1967) born Antonio Xavier Vaz, was a Goan trumpeter who led a Jazz band at the Taj Mahal Hotel in Bombay and was one of Bombay's best known jazz musicians. He was also a Hindi film music composer and played trumpet in various soundtracks.\n",
      "Chic was born Antonio Xavier Vaz in Aldona in 1916. He learned music at his local parochial school and, despite the wishes of his mother who wanted him to earn a \"respectable\" living as a mechanic, he followed his dreams of a life playing music.\n",
      "Influenced by Louis Armstrong, Chic styled himself after his great jazz hero—Chocolate's trumpet playing and \"scatting\" technique were a tribute to Armstrong. His stage presence has been recognized as dramatic, with accounts reporting that the musician would fall on one knee, while raising his instrument to the stars, during the band's crescendo. Chocolate earned the sobriquet, the \"Louis Armstrong of India\", as he not only played jazz like an African American, but also possessed a similarly dark complexion.\n"
