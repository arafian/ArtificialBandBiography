By the end of the century, they recruited guitarist Oswaldo Burruel as they started to shape up a band. Finally, joined by Annette Moreno, the band Rojo was officially formed in 2000. Rojo debuted in Los Angeles, California during a Youth Congress led by Luis Enrique Espinosa, brother of Emmanuel.\n",
