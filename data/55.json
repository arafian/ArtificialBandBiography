      "Consolidated was an American radical activist music group, formed in 1988 and best known in the early 1990s as an alternative dance/industrial music band. Between 1989 and 1994, their instrumental style evolved from industrial, to hip-hop, to hard rock and funk with mixtures of live instruments and electronic instruments. They were distinguished by left-leaning political activism and politically radical lyrics, as well as their innovative sonic collages which blended industrial and hip-hop styles.\n",
      "Their music often focused on vegetarianism, women's rights, animal rights, fighting racism and homophobia, the unity of oppression, World War II and the Holocaust, the dangers of capitalism, and the evils of American nationalism. Although often criticized as having strident and confrontational lyrics, Consolidated tempered the intensity of their songs with many instances of self-deprecating humor.  They admitted to their own struggles with addressing complex social issues within the constraining structures of pop music, an artistic form they referred to as \"a neutralized medium,\" but explained that they did so because they felt that it might be their only chance to reach a mass audience with progressive messages of social justice.\n",
      "Their signature song, \"Consolidated\", contained the mission statement \"Consolidated is not even a consumer product... yet.  This is no rock and roll band.  It is a unique creative vision of a small isolated group of individuals. A team that's skilled and dedicated.  Searching for the knowledge that will enable them to improve the quality of their lives and the lives of those around them.\"\n"
