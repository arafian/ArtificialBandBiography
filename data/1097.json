      "Mames Babegenush is a Danish Klezmer band formed in 2004 in Copenhagen.  Mames Babegenush is the East meeting the North. Strong Scandinavian roots merging with the vibrant dance music of Eastern Europe. From the great ambience of Nordic pine trees to lively weddings in Romania the music of Mames Babegenush gives a sense of both melancholy and ecstatic joy. In the beginning doing quite traditional klezmer music—with inspiration from artists such as Naftule Brandwein, Abe Schwartz and Dave Tarras—but has increasingly developed their own sound.\n",
      "The name means \"Mom's aubergine salad\" (baba ghanoush) in Yiddish.\n",
      "Mames Babegenush was founded in 2004 by a group of friends with an ambition to reform the world music and klezmer scene in Denmark. In the beginning they mainly played at Jewish weddings, bar mitzvahs and other celebrations in Copenhagen. They soon introduced a concept they called klezmer attack, spontaneous, unannounced concerts for unknowing audiences in public spaces, like cafés, parks, bars, or private celebrations. The band increasingly contributed to the world music scene in Denmark, enjoying great underground success within the first two years of the group's existence. The group has since performed all over Denmark, Europe, the US and Argentina, in Copenhagen ex VEGA, Global Cph, Copenhagen Jazzhouse, Stengade 30, Pumpehuset, the Royal Danish Theatre, both Old Stage and the Opera's main stage and TIVOLI, and abroad ex. Carnegie Hall (NYC), Paradiso (Amsterdam), Wiener Metropol (Vienna) and the Teatro Independencia (Mendoza), and festivals like NYC Gypsy Festival, Lotus Festival (Bloomington), Chicago World Music Festival, Roskilde Festival, Bergen International Festival and Festival Classique (Haag).\nIn 2007 the band began to get noticed more widely in Denmark, starting to perform at more established venues and smaller festivals. \n"
