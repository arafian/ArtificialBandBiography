         "Esplendor Geométrico is a Spanish industrial band. The band was formed in the early 1980s by Arturo Lanz, Gabriel Riaza, and Juan Carlos Sastre, who had all been members of El Aviador Dro y sus Obreros Especializados. They took the name \"Geometric Splendor\" from Geometric and Mechanical Splendor and the Numerical Sensibility (Italian: Lo splendore geometrico e meccanico e la sensibilità numerica), a text of the Italian futurist, F.T. Marinetti.\n"
