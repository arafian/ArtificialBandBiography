   "Name": "Els Pets",
   "rawData": [
      "Els Pets is a Catalan pop rock band with lead singer, composer and guitarist Lluís Gavaldà from the village of Constantí (province of Tarragona, Catalonia). Joan Reig plays drums and Falin Cáceres bass. At present, the band has the collaboration of the musicians Joan-Pau Chaves (keyboard, bass and singer), David Muñoz (guitar, singer) and Brad Jones (bass, guitar, keyboard, singer). In Catalan, Els Pets means \"The Farts\".\n",
      "In spite of the differential characteristics between this band and the rest of the groups that emerged in the late '80s and '90s decades in Catalonia, the origin of this pop-rock band can not be considered as an isolated event: it belongs to the musical movement of Rock català.\n",
      "The band Els Pets was formed in 1985 in Constantí, by Lluís Gavaldà, Joan Reig and Falin Cáceres. Two female voices joined them, Les Llufes. Unlike the trends of the leading bands that appeared in Barcelona, Els Pets were proud of their rural roots, and therefore marked their own style in opposition to the music that was made in the capital. The result was a bitter, ironic and humoristic complaint against the lack of their region. They name their genuine substyle Rock agrícola (agricultural rock). They began performing concerts in the surrounding villages, coinciding on many occasions with the local celebrations.\n"
