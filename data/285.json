      "Lillix (/ˈlɪlɪks/) was a pop rock band from Cranbrook, British Columbia, Canada, formed in 1997 when the early members were in high school. The band was originally an all-girl group under the name Tigerlily composed of guitarist Tasha-Ray Evin, keyboardist Lacey-Lee Evin, bassist Louise Burns, and drummer Sierra Hills. In 2001 the band was signed by Maverick Records and changed their name to Lillix as there was another band called Tigerlily. Hills left in 2002 and was replaced by Kim Urhahn, and later by Alicia Warrington. The band was considered on hiatus from late 2006 through 2009 due to the folding of their label, Maverick Records, and officially disbanded after the release of their independent third album in 2010.\n",
      "Under their original name of Tigerlily, the group sent their demo to an industry lawyer named Jonathan Simkin, who liked the band's sound and helped promote them to record labels. The group ultimately ended up signing with Maverick Records in 2001 and changed their name to Lillix. Their debut album Falling Uphill was released in Canada and the United States on 27 May 2003 and in Japan on 27 August 2003. \"It's About Time\" was released as the band's first single in the spring of 2003 and reached 33 on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 airplay chart. It was followed that fall by \"Tomorrow\", which did not enter the Billboard pop chart but did reach number 48 on the Radio & Records CHR/Pop Top 50 chart tracking airplay on contemporary hit radio stations. Falling Uphill also featured a cover of \"What I Like About You\" by The Romantics, which was featured on the 2003 Freaky Friday soundtrack and the soundtrack for the film 13 Going on 30, and serves as the theme song for the comedy series of the same name. The band received two nominations at the 2004 Junos.\n",
      "The second album, Inside the Hollow, was released in Canada on 29 August 2006 and in Japan on 6 September 2006. The only single from this album is \"Sweet Temptation (Hollow)\". This album's release featured drummer Alicia Warrington in October 2005.\n"
