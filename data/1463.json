      "The Hamilton Police Pipe Band is a competitive pipe band based in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.  Currently, the Hamilton Police Pipe Band consists of a competing grade 4 band, a developing grade 5 band, and a teaching program. The Hamilton Police Pipe Band has had many successful seasons under its most recent leadership of drum sergeant Sandy McKail and pipe major Trish Kirkwood. Over the last 15 years the two have led HPPB to many local and North American prizes and titles such as North American champions, Canadian champions, Transatlantic champions, Nova Scotia champions, and 1st placings in many PPBSO Highland games across Ontario.\n",
      "Pipe major Trish Kirkwood is the current pipe major and over the last 15+ years has had major success taking a grade 5 band up to grade 2. Kirkwood passed the band to John Elliot after the 2017 World Pipe Band Championship, stepping down to pipe sergeant while still being part of the management team. Under the direction of Elliot, the band competed in grade 2 until its folding in 2018. Kirkwood resumed the pipe major position after the folding of the grade 2 band in 2018, now competing in grade 4.\n",
      "Sandy Mckail was a huge part of the HPPB restructuring after the band's second grade two band folded almost 15 years ago. McKail had been the leading drummer and drumming instruction for all levels, up to grade 2, building winning drum scores for snare and midsection, McKail would tie the band together, providing a complementary ensemble perspective that seemed to always elevate the musical feeling and expression of the band.  His drum score arrangements dominated the junior grades for almost a decade.\n"
