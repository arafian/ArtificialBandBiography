      "The group is made up of five women: Bea, Cova, Malela, Montse, and Natalia. Also Eugenia was a member of the group, but she left. The setup of the band is as follows: Natalia sings; Bea plays the guitar; Malela plays the guitar and sings; Montse plays the bass and sings; and Cova plays the drums. Eugenia played the bass.\n",
      "One 1994 night in a bar of Gijón, the five music-lover friends are cheerfully talking, when the possibility of making up a new music group arises. That very night, the group has chosen a name and the roles have been assigned. So they start to practise, and they compose some songs.\n"
