   "rawData": [
      "Omega Tribe are an English anarcho-punk band, formed in Barnet, London in 1981.  With the roles of Hugh Vivian on guitar and vocals, Daryl Hardcastle on bass, Pete Fender on guitar and Pete Shepherd on drums, their first EP, Angry Songs, was produced by Penny Rimbaud and Pete Fender for Crass Records in 1982.\n",
      "Their subsequent LP, No Love Lost, (released by Corpus Christi Records, 1983) won the hearts of many hardened anarchos and secured their place in anarcho-punk history. A far more melodic style, encouraged by producer and new guitarist Pete Fender (from Rubella Ballet), created a highly influential template that many other bands were to build on. \n",
      "They released a cassette only live release on BBP tapes (www.bbprecords.co.uk) in 1984. \n"
