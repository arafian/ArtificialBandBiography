      "Freak Kitchen is an experimental rock band from Gothenburg, Sweden, formed in 1992.\n",
      "Freak Kitchen's style of music is influenced by many genres besides the traditional heavy metal, ranging from jazz to pop. The band described their third album as \"A corny little heavy-pop-rock-Latin-world-jazz-avant-garde-metal-blues-record straight from hell!\".\nThe album \"Land of the Freaks\", which was released in late October 2009, features Indian inspiration and the band is also joined by the two Indian musicians V. Selvaganesh and Neyveli S Radhakrishna on several tracks.\n",
      "The lyrics of Freak Kitchen often contain humor and criticism of capitalist society, conformity, racism and the attitude of major labels.\n"
