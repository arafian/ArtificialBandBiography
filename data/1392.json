      "Growing is a drone music/ambient music/noise music band formed in Olympia, Washington, and currently based in Brooklyn, New York.  The group was founded in 2001 by Kevin Doria (electric bass guitar), Joe Denardo (electric guitar), and Zack Carlson (drums). Carlson left following their first album, and the band continued as a duo until 2009, when they recruited Sadie Laska (samplers, microphone) to form a new trio. The group's music has gradually progressed from slow, instrumental drone pieces through works in noise and ambient music toward more propulsive, rhythm driven music. Their live shows are consistently known for being very loud and for playing straight through their set without breaks or banter between songs.\n",
      "Growing have released albums on labels such as Kranky, Animal Disguise, Archive, Megablade/Troubleman, and The Social Registry.  At the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008 Growing released their first two releases for The Social Registry; a 7-inch single for the label Social Club series and a mini-lp entitled Lateral. In 2010 they released an album on Vice Records.\n",
      "In April 2008 Growing embarked on a tour of Europe and the United Kingdom with the Japanese band Boris.\n"
