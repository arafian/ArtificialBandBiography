      "The Del-Byzanteens was a New York-based no wave band active in the early 1980s. The band comprised Phil Kline (vocals, guitar); Jim Jarmusch (vocals, keyboards); Philippe Hagen (bass); Josh Braun (percussion, drums); and Dan Braun (drums, percussion). Luc Sante wrote the lyrics to some of their songs, while James Nares sometimes contributed as a percussionist, and occasionally John Lurie performed with them on stage.\n",
      "They released a 12\" EP: Girl's Imagination (1981), an LP: Lies to Live By (1982), and a 7\" single: Draft Riot (1982). In 1985-86 they recorded two more songs (\"The Last Time\" and \"Fascination\"), which were never finished or officially released.\n",
      "\"At that time everyone in New York had a band,\" Jarmusch recalled in an interview for The Washington Post (1984). \"The idea was that you didn't have to be a virtuoso musician to have a band. The spirit was more important than having technical expertise, and that influenced a lot of filmmakers.\" According to Sante, they were \"a band that insouciantly blended high and low, virtuosity and amateurism, calypso and science fiction, pots and pans and drones and the Supremes. They released several records, on a British label, which did very well in the former Yugoslavia.\"\n"
