      "Piglet was a short-lived American, Chicago-based instrumental math rock band, formed by the former members of the band Seyarse. Their style of music is labeled such things as \"math rock,\" \"indie rock', \"post rock\" \"experimental rock,\" and instrumental rock, among others. The song structures mainly focus around clean and melodic, yet heavily complicated and technical playing which contains pleasant hooks, backed by fittingly technically demanding drumming. The band broke up after releasing their debut EP, Lava Land, on the label Team AV, in 2005. In April of 2020, Lava Land was ranked #4 in a readers poll published by Fecking Bahamas of the 50 greatest math rock albums of all time.\n",
      "Due to popular demand the band ran a Kick Starter campaign in 2013 to release Lava Land on vinyl.  The LP is limited to a pressing of 1,000 copies, 900 on purple vinyl and a limited run of 100 on clear vinyl.  The campaign was such a success, Piglet were able to also package and release a CDEP called \"Songs\" which contains live multi-track recordings of all of the band's post-\"Lava Land\" material.  Recorded live at the Beat Kitchen in Chicago, \"Songs\", is limited to 500 copies with artwork and hand printed packaging by Kyle Maj.\n",
      "In 2010 Ezra Sandzer-Bell released a series of solo recordings through Kansas City record label Overland Shark.\n"
