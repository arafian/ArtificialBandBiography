      "Tangleweed is a three-person acoustic Americana band from Chicago, Illinois. They have five full-length CDs, and were included on the \"Old Town School of Folk Music Songbook Series, Volume 2\", on Bloodshot Records. Their recording of the Ola Belle Reed song \"High On a Mountain\" is featured in episode eight of the 2007 Roadtrip Nation series on PBS.\n",
      "The group performs approximately 75 dates a year, traveling as far as Hawaii, and has been featured at major festivals such as Wakarusa, the Chicago Country Music Fest, and the Folk and Roots Fest.\n",
      "In 2004, the group recorded their first full-length CD, \"Just a Spoonful (and other Folksongs of Rural Cook County)\", with noted engineer Bob Weston. The record was made as a modern field recording in an empty Chicago two flat, capturing the band live to two-track analog tape, using vintage recording equipment. In stark contrast to most modern recordings, the CD was made without edits or overdubs. The album's tunes drew from old-time country (Train 45, Katy Kline), Blues (Spoonful), Bluegrass (Orange Blossom Special), and Jazz (Duke Ellington's C Jam Blues).The record received rave reviews from the music press in publications such as Sing Out!, Bluegrass Unlimited, and the Chicago Reader. Chicago Reader music critic Monica Kendrick also drew attention to the CD's humorous liner notes, written by Jazz critic Alexander Gelfand and mandolinist Kenneth Rainey.\n"
