      "The Stonehouse Pipe Band is a pipe band from Stonehouse in the South Lanarkshire region of Scotland\n",
      "The band was formed in 1899 under the leadership of Pipe major Hector McIness, and grew steadily during the pre-war years at the beginning of the last century.\n",
      "In 1909 Harry Lauder suggested a competition for civilian bands at the Cowal Gathering. He had been a miner and knew that many mining villages had pipe bands which would struggle to compete against the military bands in the Argyll Shield. So the civilian contest for the Sir Harry Lauder Shield began. The Argyll Shield is now the award for Grade One at Cowal, while the Sir Harry Lauder Shield is the award for Grade Two.\n"
