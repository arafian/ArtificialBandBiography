         "The band was founded in 1992 in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany by Thorsten Benning, Morten Gass, Robin Rodenberg and Reiner Henseleit. Originally, group members started out playing in various hardcore bands such as 7 Inch Boots and Chronical Diarrhoea.[1] In 1992 they produced a crossover of jazz and ambient, which they self-described as an \"unholy ambient mixture of slow jazz ballads, Black Sabbath doom and down-tuned Autopsy sounds\". Henseleit left the band in 1996 and was replaced by Christoph Clöser in 1997, replacing the guitar with a saxophone at the same time.[2]\n"
