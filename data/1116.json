      "The Adored were an American power pop, garage and punk band based in Los Angeles, California, United States. Until 2007, they were signed to V2 Records in North America (reportedly signed by former Black Flag and Circle Jerks frontman Keith Morris).\n They released a five-song EP in 2004, which featured guest vocals by Pete Shelley of Buzzcocks on two songs; and their debut LP, A New Language, was released in 2006.\n",
      "The band was made up of Ryan George (vocals), Nathanael Keefer (drums), Drew Bayers (guitar) and Max Humphrey (bass). George and Keefer originally met as Central Coast teenagers, through George'sstraight edge hardcore punk band Carry On, with whom Keefer later played drums. Keefer later left Carry On and moved to Los Angeles, and George followed suit shortly after the release of their LP A Life Less Plagued.\n",
      "Their relationship with the Buzzcocks began when Pete Shelley met the band at their first New York City show in 2004. The most obvious and frequently cited source of the band's name is The Stone Roses song \"I Wanna Be Adored.\"\n"
