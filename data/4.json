      "Blood Circus was a short-lived band from Seattle, Washington formed in 1988 that has been described as sludge metal or grunge. Rock journalist Ned Raggett writing in Allmusic describes the band's music as \"rough and ready, sludgy guitar rock with a bad attitude\".\n",
      "The band's first release was a single, 1988's \"Two Way Street\"/\"Six Foot Under\", on Sub Pop. Both Mudhoney and Nirvana performed their first shows in Seattle opening for Blood Circus at the Vogue in 1988.\n",
      "In 1989 Sub Pop released the band's first and only album, a five-track EP called Primal Rock Therapy which, despite being now recognised as a milestone record of that time and place, was at the time panned by the critics and ignored by the public. This contributed to the split of the band in 1989 after a North American tour with the French band Les Thugs.  Both bands played in San Francisco in June 1989.\n"
