      "text": [
         "The band's first release was a single, 1988's \"Two Way Street\"/\"Six Foot Under\", on Sub Pop. Both Mudhoney and Nirvana performed their first shows in Seattle opening for Blood Circus at the Vogue in 1988.[4]\n",
         "In 1989 Sub Pop released the band's first and only album, a five-track EP called Primal Rock Therapy which, despite being now recognised as a milestone record of that time and place, was at the time panned by the critics and ignored by the public. This contributed to the split of the band in 1989 after a North American tour with the French band Les Thugs.[5]  Both bands played in San Francisco in June 1989.\n",
         "They briefly reformed in 1992, when Sub Pop re-released Primal Rock Therapy on CD with five additional unreleased tracks.[2] The rerelease comprised almost all of the band's recorded output, except for the song \"The Outback\", which can be found on the Sub Pop 200 compilation. The band also briefly appeared in the 1996 film Hype!, a documentary about the rise of the Seattle scene.\n",
         "Blood Circus performed a one-off reunion show at Seattle's Crocodile Cafe in 2007.[6]\n",
         "In April 2012 Geoff Robinson conducted a comprehensive audio interview with Music Life Radio about Blood Circus, and his life. \n",
         "In May 2017 \"Six Foot Under\" was included on the Deluxe Reissue of the Singles Soundtrack Singles: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.\n"
