         "The group performed several shows early in the year before Kreutzmann became involved in The Dead tour.[5] They toured North America again during the summer of 2009 although due to touring commitments with the Allman Brothers Band and a desire to spend more time at home, Oteil Burbridge was replaced by James \"Hutch\" Hutchinson from Bonnie Raitt's band.[2] Bill Kreutzmann speculated that they would release a live album although, to date, this has not occurred.[6] Nonetheless, most of the band's recordings were recorded and made available by tapers.\n",
         "They performed a few shows in California early in 2010 with Oteil Burbridge back in the band[7][8][9] but since then they have remained largely inactive.\n",
         "Despite not having toured since 2010, they (Bill, Scott and Oteil) played as BK3 at \"Jungle Jam\" in Jaco, Costa Rica in 2011 and 2012.\n"
