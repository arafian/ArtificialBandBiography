      "BK3 were an American rock band led by Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann. Kreutzmann formed the band in 2008 with Max Creek guitarist Scott Murawski and Allman Brothers Band bassist Oteil Burbridge.\n",
      "Bill Kreutzmann and Scott Murawski were introduced to each other in early 2008 by Mike Gordon and the three performed together as a trio at a benefit in Costa Rica. Kreutzmann and Murawski then decided to form a full-time band and they offered Gordon the bassist position but he had to decline due to his other projects. Kreutzmann then offered the position up to Allman Brothers Band bassist Oteil Burbridge and he accepted.\n",
      "They dubbed themselves the Bill Kreutzmann Trio and successfully toured the northeast during the summer of 2008 including a stop at the Gathering of the Vibes. The group played many Grateful Dead songs, Max Creek songs and covers as well as new songs written by Robert Hunter.\n"
