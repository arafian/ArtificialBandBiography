         "Pigeons Playing Ping Pong began in 2009. They released their first full-length album titled Funk E P in 2010.[4][5] This album name is a play on words says vocalist/guitarist Greg Ormont, and unfortunately the name led people to think this first album was just an EP. In July 2014, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong released their second full-length album titled Psychology.[1][4][6][7][8][9] Pigeons Playing Ping Pong has hosted Domefest every year since 2009. The location of the festival has changed periodically but is currently held at Marvin's Mountaintop in Masontown, WV. In a 2017 interview,[10] Greg Ormont (vocals/guitar) said, \"We met in college at the University of Maryland and the dorm project turned into the real thing. We've been playing for over 8 years. We've been touring the country for 4–5 years and just having a blast spreading our high energy psychedelic funk and good vibes. We like to bring the party and show people a diverse time that is positive and fun and everyone leaves a happier person.”\n",
         "In November 2019, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong announced that they would be releasing their 5th studio album in 2020. It is led by singles \"King Kong\" and \"Dawn A New Day.\"[11][12]\n"
