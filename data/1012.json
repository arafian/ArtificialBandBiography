      "Pigeons Playing Ping Pong is an American funk jam band from Baltimore, Maryland. The band has garnered a following as a result of their consistent touring, playing as many as two hundred shows a year.\n",
      "Pigeons Playing Ping Pong began in 2009. They released their first full-length album titled Funk E P in 2010. This album name is a play on words says vocalist/guitarist Greg Ormont, and unfortunately the name led people to think this first album was just an EP. In July 2014, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong released their second full-length album titled Psychology. Pigeons Playing Ping Pong has hosted Domefest every year since 2009. The location of the festival has changed periodically but is currently held at Marvin's Mountaintop in Masontown, WV. In a 2017 interview, Greg Ormont (vocals/guitar) said, \"We met in college at the University of Maryland and the dorm project turned into the real thing. We've been playing for over 8 years. We've been touring the country for 4–5 years and just having a blast spreading our high energy psychedelic funk and good vibes. We like to bring the party and show people a diverse time that is positive and fun and everyone leaves a happier person.”\n",
      "In November 2019, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong announced that they would be releasing their 5th studio album in 2020. It is led by singles \"King Kong\" and \"Dawn A New Day.\"\n"
