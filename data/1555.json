      "Domestic! Virgin Line (stylised as DOMESTIC! Virgin LINE) is a brief concert tour by Japanese band Tokyo Jihen. The tour was the first of two to support their second album, Adult (2006). Unlike most of the band's tours, a video album was never produced, however a Fuji Television program called Tokyo Jihen Live in Nippon Budokan was produced to showcase the performance.\n",
      "Tokyo Jihen was first formed in 2003, after Ringo Sheena decided on members for her backing band for her Sugoroku Ecstasy tour. The band was officially announced as Sheena's main musical unit on May 31, 2004. This was followed by their debut album Ky≈çiku in November 2004, and a 14 date Japan-wide tour entitled Dynamite!.\n",
      "After the Dynamite! tour, two of the original members of the band made decisions to leave. Pianist H Zetto M left to focus on his activities with jazz ensemble Pe'z, while guitarist Mikio Hirama left to focus on his activities as a solo musician. Sheena sought new members to replace them, and asked pianist Ichiyo Izawa, who she had known since 2004, and Ryosuke Nagaoka, a guitarist Sheena had met through her brother Junpei Shiina who often collaborated on her demo takes. The band began to record their second album Adult in July 2005.\n"
