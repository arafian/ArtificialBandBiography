Flattbush recorded their Koolarrow Records debut, Smash The Octopus, produced by Bill Gould that same year and released in 2003.  Following Flattbushs' first tour of the United States in 2003, Ramon Banda resigned and was replaced by drummer Joe Luevano before their second headlining tour of the United States in 2004 and again in 2005.  Flattbush maintains a legacy for being one of the most underground and wildest acts in Grindcore.\n",
