      "Cub (also stylized cub) was an indie pop band from Vancouver, British Columbia that formed in 1992 and disbanded in 1997. They played a melodic, jangly form of pop punk that was dubbed \"cuddlecore\" by some music critics.\n",
      "The group was emblematic of the twee pop and cuddlecore style. At their cozy, casual live shows, they sometimes played in their pajamas, and gave out presents to audience members.\n",
