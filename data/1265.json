            "R5 is made up of brothers Riker Lynch, Rocky Lynch, Ross Lynch, and their sister Rydel Lynch, all born and raised in Littleton, Colorado, and their family friend Ellington Ratliff, whom they met at a California dance studio called the Rage.[7] About a year after meeting, they asked Ratliff to join the band.[8] While living in Colorado, the Lynch siblings went to a performing arts school. They used to put on shows for their family and charged them at least a dollar to watch them perform in their basement.[7] At age 16, Riker decided he wanted to move to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. Their parents, Mark and Stormie, moved the entire family there in order to stay together. Shortly after the move, the siblings began appearing in commercials, while Rocky began teaching himself, Ross and Riker how to play guitar.[9]\n",
