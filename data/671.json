            "Hinds started in 2011 as a duo called Deers, consisting of Carlotta Cosials and Ana García Perrote.[6] After a break of a year and a half, the duo reformed in 2013.

In June 2014 Deers played London for the first time and the following month \"Demo\" was released on vinyl by the record labels Lucky Number Music (UK) and Mom + Pop Music (USA).[13] Later in 2014 they also played Germany and France, amongst other countries, and supported The Libertines,[14] The Vaccines[15] and Black Lips.[16]\n",
            "During this time they received positive reviews in Pitchfork,[17] Pigeons and Planes,[18] Gorilla vs. Bear,[19] The Irish Times,[20] Paste,[1] and DIY.[21][22] On 3 November 2014, they released the single \"Barn\" with the tracks \"Castigadas en el granero\" (\"Punished in the Barn\") and \"Between Cans\". Once again it was released by Lucky Number[23] and was well received by the press.[9][17][22]\n"

            "The third Hinds studio album, The Prettiest Curse, was released on 5 June 2020 on Mom + Pop Music. It was originally scheduled for 3 April 2020, but was delayed because of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic. It includes more diverse instrumentation than previous albums, as well as singing in Spanish.[38] In an interview with The Forty-Five the band explained their decision to change their management for this album: \"We were under a lot of pressure from our team, part of our management. They started blaming us for venues not selling out. Everyone was frustrated and it made us really sad.\"[39]  During the pandemic, Hinds recorded a video performance of two songs, \"New For You\" and \"Come Back and Love Me\". The video was recorded separately at each band members' home and edited together for release through Rolling Stone's website.[40]\n",
            "In the recording sessions for The Prettiest Curse, the band also recorded a cover of \"Spanish Bombs\" by The Clash. Explaining why they chose that song, the band said, \"As Spaniards, we don’t usually get shout-outs in songs, like New York or London, so the Clash writing a song about our civil war made us feel honored.\" They released the song on 31 July 2020 and performed it on 21 August 2020 during a live stream 68th birthday tribute show to Joe Strummer called \"A Song for Joe: Celebrating the Life of Joe Strummer\".[41][42]\n",
            "On 21 August 2020, Hinds released a single jointly with Japanese band CHAI called \"United Girls Rock'n'Roll Club\", which has lyrics in Spanish, Japanese, and English. The song was released with a music video.[43]\n"

         "Overall, Hinds are considered a garage rock, garage pop and lo-fi band, and have been compared to a blend of rock bands such as Velvet Underground, The Pastels, and C86-like bands, contemporary garage rock and 1960s groups with a pop sound,[9][11][44] although they have mentioned Black Lips, Ty Segall, The Parrots, The Strokes, The Vaccines, and Mac DeMarco as their main influences.[9][16][45]\n"
