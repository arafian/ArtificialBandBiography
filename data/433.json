         "Fono formed under the name Seven (and originally from Milton Keynes), and released one album and one EP under this name; they also opened for a UK concert by Bon Jovi before changing their name to Fono in 1998.[1] Lead singer Del Currie had previously played with Split Level and Tribe of Dan,[1] and went on a year-long hiatus from songwriting and performing before putting the group together.[2] The band has stated that the name \"Fono\" has no significance; in an interview, Currie said \"It means absolutely nothing\".[3]  Following the name change, the group was featured in Kerrang! magazine as one of their Best Unsigned Bands. Not long after, they did sign with a label, and the group released their debut full-length, Goesaroundcomesaround, in 1999.[4] Album reviewers noted the album's American, as opposed to British, rock sound[5][6] and the group's general appeal to audiences outside the world of Christian rock.[7] In America, the group scored two Christian radio hits with the singles \"Now She's 24\" (No. 7, 1999) and \"Drift Away\" ( 16, 2000).[1] They also toured with Robert Plant, The Goo Goo Dolls,[1] Third Eye Blind,[8] and Audio Adrenaline.[7]\n",
         "After the release of the album, the band relocated permanently to the United States, settling in  San Diego, California in 2000.[8] That year, a restructuring at their record label resulted in their becoming embroiled in a lawsuit which took over two years to resolve; during this time the band was prevented from recording any music.[9] They then began recording a new album, but the studio where they were recording and all of their equipment and masters were destroyed in the Cedar Fire of 2003.[9] The group re-recorded the material and independently released It's the Way That You Use It in 2004 and Too Broken to Break in 2007.\n",
         "In 2010, vocalist Del Currie released a solo album under the name Zoo Seven.\n"
