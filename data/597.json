      "Audrey is a Swedish four-piece post-rock band formed in Henån, Sweden in 2001.\n",
      "The band first formed in a run-down music house that was going to be demolished during their time there. According to the band there were mice running on the floor and the pipes were frozen. In this harsh environment they started playing together. After Rebecka Kristiansson and Victoria Skoglund graduated from high school they decided to move to Gothenburg. Anna and Emelie followed shortly and Gothenburg opened up some new opportunities for them, the city providing a larger scene and audience.\n",
      "In Gothenburg they came in contact with some other musicians, whom later helped them record a demo in the studio of an artist's collective in the summer of 2003. The demo helped them get more live shows in Sweden.\n"
