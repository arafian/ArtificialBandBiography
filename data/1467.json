      "The Vancouver Police Pipe Band is a Canadian pipe band based in Vancouver, British Columbia. It is the official police band of the Vancouver Police Department and is considered to be the official band of the City of Vancouver. It performs for all citywide, provincial, national and international events available to them. Like many pipe bands in the British and Canadian Army, they performs in full highland dress which includes a feather bonnet. It is the oldest non-military pipe band in British Columbia and ranks amongst the most senior police pipe bands in Canada. In its international visits, it has performed in countries such as Singapore, Japan, and the United States.\n",
      "The band's foundation in June 1914 occurred at the opening of the new police station on Cordova Street, during which a handful of pipers within the department were mobilized to play for the opening ceremonies. As a result, Chief Constable Malcolm MacLennan authorized the formation of a departmental pipe band. At the time, it was one of a handful of police musical units in the world. In its history, it has recorded three compilations including The Pipe Band (1978), Music in Motion (1983), and 90 Years on the Beat (2004).\n",
      "In January 2018, a film covering the pipe band was released titled The Queens New Guard. Premiering at the Vancouver International Film Centre, it focused on the band's visit to London in 2014. The Vancouver Police Foundation made a large contribution to the creation of the documentary and was also funded through contributions on Kickstarter. Proceeds went to the Gordon Sinclair Fund, a charity set up in memory of band member Gordon Sinclair who was killed in 1955.\n"
