            "According to founding member Derek Stipe's website, the band broke up despite their success because their label shut down.[6] Afterwards, Derek Stipe and Kevin Stipe joined with Dan Ruiz to form the Stipe Brothers group and play music at festivals and breweries in their home region of North Carolina. Their former Monday Morning colleague Kent Rector, bassist Jeff Hinkle,[7] and Eric Congdon have joined the group for some events.[8] In 2018 Derek Stipe recorded a solo EP, The Sinking Ship.[6]\n"

After playing with a few other people, the group eventually narrowed down to four members: the Stipe brothers, Rector, and Justin Blythe who they knew from their church.[1] Lead singer Stipe said, \"We thought we kinda had something special, so we started playing out, getting better, and it just exploded from there.\"[1]\n",

No more games, masks, or half truths. That is the boldness we want our music to have.\"[1] In 2001 they released the three-track Monday Morning EP,[2] followed by Blind in 2002.[3]\n",
