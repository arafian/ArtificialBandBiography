The band recorded demo tapes and passed them on to fans at their shows and fellow Seattle bands, such as Soundgarden, Mudhoney, and Melvins. In 1988, the group officially disbanded. Kurt Danielson formed his new band, Tad, with former drummer Tad Doyle. Dan Peters became the drummer in another local band, Feast, which disbanded shortly after he joined.
