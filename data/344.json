      "Rose Chronicles was a Canadian alternative rock band in the 1990s. The band, from Vancouver, consisted of vocalist Kristy Thirsk, guitarist Richard Maranda, bassist Judd Cochrane and drummer Steve van der Woerd.\n",
      "Their musical style merged elements of the shoegazing scene — they cited Curve as one of their key influences — with ethereal dream pop vocals in the style of Sarah McLachlan and the Cocteau Twins.\n",
      "The band was first formed in 1992 by Maranda, Hand, and Van Der Woerd, with Thirsk and Cochrane joining soon afterward after responding to a classified advertisement in The Georgia Straight. By the end of the year, they had signed to Nettwerk after their third live show.\n"
