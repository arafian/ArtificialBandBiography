      "Set Your Goals is an American rock band from San Francisco, California, formed in 2004. Their band name is derived from the CIV album of the same name.\n",
      "The band consists of vocalists Jordan Brown and Matt Wilson, drummer Mike Ambrose, guitarists Audelio Flores Jr and Daniel Coddaire and bassist Joe Saucedo.\n",
      "Forming in 2004, Set Your Goals released their first self-titled EP through Straight on Records in May 2004. The band embarked on some of their first tours with The Warriors and Make Move, as the word circulated about the EP they were approached by a number of labels. After \"touring off of that alone for almost 2 years\", they signed with Eulogy Recordings and re-released the EP under the name Reset in April 2005. Audelio Flores joined the band on April 2006, after playing in a band called Amity from Los Angeles. Their second release on Eulogy was their debut studio album, entitled Mutiny!, which was released in July 2006. During winter of 2007 Dave Yoha amicably left the band due to tour exhaust. Daniel Coddaire returned for touring before he rejoined the band officially in 2008; Coddaire was Set Your Goals' original lead guitarist.\n"
