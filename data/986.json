As Joe Russo recalls in the September 2017 Relix Magazine interview, he was supposed to play in the Dean Ween Group (Mickey Melchiondo from Ween's side project) on that second night but shortly before the date, Mickey cancelled the Dean Ween Group appearance and Joe pulled together Bustle In Your Hedgerow (Russo, Dreiwitz, Metzger and Benevento's Led Zeppelin band) and added Tom Hamilton to form Joe Russo's Almost Dead.[1] JRAD played one more show that year at the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, New York on December 27, 2013.\n"

            "In 2017 JRAD performed forty shows including their first headlining indoor arena show, their first headlining Red Rocks Amphitheatre show and a return to the Dominican Republic for their second year in a row at Dominican Holidaze. Their first headlining arena show at the 1stBank Center in Broomfield, Colorado was a sold-out show originally scheduled for Red Rocks Amphitheatre but due to a late spring snowstorm, the concert was relocated overnight to the 1stBank Center.[9] The band also performed twelve sold out nights at the Brooklyn Bowl in New York City during the Spring and Fall of 2017. On March 9, the first night of the spring Brooklyn Bowl run and the band's one-hundredth concert, they premiered Russo and Hamilton's \"Keeping it Simple\", their first-ever original song.[10] For three of the Brooklyn Bowl performances Oteil Burbridge filled in for Dreiwitz while on Ween tour.[11]  On August 31, 2017 the band headlined a sold-out performance at Red Rocks with Oteil Burbridge on bass guitar filling in for Dreiwitz out on Ween tour.  In October, between the dates of the 5th-7th and the 12th-14th, the band performed the latter six sold-out shows at the Brooklyn Bowl.  JRAD's 125th show saw John Mayer, current lead-guitarist of Dead & Company, sitting in on guitar on Friday, October 13 in the first and second set of the show.[12]\n"

      "text": [
         "JRAD is known for their intermingling of the Grateful Dead's recognizable folk-rock and Americana sound with more contemporary Progressive Rock and Jazz Fusion influences. Most of their performances start with 3â€“7 minutes of improvisation, starting with a simple drumbeat, slowly bringing in each musician, and then suddenly beginning a song in unison. Each of the musicians all have their own projects outside of the band, giving them a depth and breadth of different experiences in composition and improvisation which enables them to steer improvisations in myriad directions during their solos. Their live performance is highly regarded for its long, exploratory improvisation, high energy playing, alternating solos, and rapid juxtaposition in tempo and dynamics. Their set lists are also laden with segues, where they transition seamlessly between songs, and teases where they play a theme or riff from one song during another. Some notable examples of this include Tom Hamilton playing the guitar riff to \"Feel Like a Stranger\" during his solos or the band jumping back and forth between \"The Wheel\" and \"Uncle John's Band\".\n",
         "Keyboardist Marco Benevento is known for having at least one extended solo during each show where the band will stop playing entirely. During these solos Marco has led his solo improvisation to tease many different songs such as Tchaikovsky's \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\", Radiohead's \"Paranoid Android\" and Radiohead's \"Everything in Its Right Place\". These extended solos, after exploring a different sonic space, often build in energy and lead to the band rapidly joining in, leading the improvisation to a peak and getting quiet again rapidly.\n"
