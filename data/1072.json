         "Moshiach Oi! was started in 2008 by singer/guitarist Yishai Romanoff, who had sought to reconcile his then-recently renewed Jewish faith with the punk rock music he had loved as a teenager.[1] Initially a solo act, Romanoff eventually brought in his friend Mike Wagner, as well as bassist Mitchell \"Mordechai\" Harrison and drummer Paul \"Pesach\" Alpert, to complete the band.[2][3] The band's name is derived from a combination Moshiach, the Jewish name for the Messiah; oy vey, a Yiddish expression conveying exasperation and dismay; and Oi!, a British working-class genre of punk music.[2][3]\n",
         "The group's debut album, Better Get Ready, produced by Wagner and mastered by veteran punk producer Don Fury, was released by Shemspeed Records and the band's own Shabasa Records label on August 25, 2009.[2] A second album, This World is Nothing, was released two years later just on Shabasa,[4] accompanied by the single and music video \"Got Nothing On Me\". The band was prominently featured in the 2012 documentary Punk Jews.[5]\n",
         "A third album, Rock Rabeinu, was released on August 10, 2017.\n"

         "Moshiach Oi's music combines the sound of traditional hardcore punk with lyrics that promote Jewish ideals and values. While the music is inspired by Romanoff's teenage love of punk bands like Leftöver Crack and F-Minus,[1] lyrical topics include blessing God, Shabbat, Torah study, idolatry, Moshiach, and Rebbe Nachman of Breslov.[6] Patrick Aleph of the website Jewcy summarized Better Get Ready as \"a blistering punk rock siddurim that effortlessly ties together Black Flag and Rambam, 7 Seconds and the Rebbe, The Casualties and the Kabballists.\"[7]\n"
