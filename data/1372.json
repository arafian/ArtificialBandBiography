   "Name": "Certain General",
   "rawData": [
      "Certain General is an American post-punk band formed in 1980 by Parker Dulany, Phil Gammage, Marcy Saddy, and Russell Berke. BOMP! Records has called them \"NYC's 80's cult favorite, while Rock & Folk identified the band as \"the bridge between Television and Radiohead.\n",
      "In the liner notes for Introduction to War (2001), their former manager, Stephen Graziano, called them, \"... the baddest, craziest, most misbehaved but mind bendingly brilliant band that was walking the Earth.\" This coincides with Mojo magazine's assessment that \"the story of Certain General is one of triumph, tragedy, and often dazzling music.\"'\n",
      "Drawing on a tradition established by New York rock bands such as the Velvet Underground, Certain General has recorded and performed extensively in the United States and Europe. Although various personnel and label changes have occurred over the years, Dulany and Gammage, along with Kevin Tooley, continue to record and perform.\n"
