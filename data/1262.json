            "Plans to record a follow-up to Era Vulgaris had been mentioned since 2008,[50] but recording would not begin until August 2012.[48] In March 2011, Homme stated, \"Doing the rehearsals for the first record is really defining the new one. It's been turning the new record into something else. What we were doing was bluesy, and now it's turned into this trancey, broken thing. The robots are coming home!\"[51] According to Homme, the album would be finished by the end of 2012. He explained to BBC Radio 1, \"We're going to take our one last break that we would get for a month, come back and do Glastonbury, then immediately jump in the studio. Our record will be done by the end of the year. We have enough songs.\"[52]\n",
            "In November 2011, frequent collaborator Alain Johannes stated in regard to his studio work with the band: \"We had a late night with Queens of the Stone Age again. [...] Just putting in days, super top secret, but it’s going to be amazing. I’m really excited about it. [...] Once we start the process, it goes to completion. So I can’t say exactly when, but it’s a really good start.\"[53]\n",
            "On August 20, 2012, the band stated via a Facebook status update that they were \"recording\" their new album.[54]\n",
            "In September 2012, it was revealed that Homme and producer Dave Sardy co-wrote and recorded a song entitled \"Nobody To Love,\" which is featured during the end credits of the film End of Watch.[55][56]\n",
            "In November 2012, Homme informed BBC's Zane Lowe that Joey Castillo had left the band and that drums on the new album would be performed by Dave Grohl, who also performed on Songs for the Deaf.[57] Homme also confirmed with Lowe that the album would be released prior to their performance at the Download Festival in June 2013. In addition to Grohl, other former members contributing to the album include former bassists Nick Oliveri[58] and Johannes,[59] and vocalist Mark Lanegan.[60]\n",
            "A number of collaborations from different musicians were announced for ...Like Clockwork, including Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor,[61] Scissor Sisters frontman Jake Shears,[62] Brody Dalle,[59] and Elton John.[63]\n",
            "In early 2013, Homme and fellow Queens contributors including Alain Johannes and Chris Goss recorded for the soundtrack of Dave Grohl's Sound City: Real to Reel. Goss, Johannes and Homme were on three tracks each. Josh's notably included a collaboration with Grohl and Trent Reznor called Mantra, and he was also featured in the film in an interview segment. Goss and Johannes were both featured members in the Sound City Players, playing Masters of Reality, Eleven, and Desert Sessions songs, as well as their penned tunes from the soundtrack. Former Kyuss bassist Scott Reeder also contributed to the soundtrack.[64]\n",
            "In March 2013, Queens of the Stone Age announced that the new album, entitled ...Like Clockwork, would be released in June 2013 on Matador Records.[65][66] A press release, issued by Matador at 9:00am EST on March 26, 2013, revealed further details of the album, including further guest appearances: Alex Turner of Arctic Monkeys and UNKLE's James Lavelle. In addition to Grohl's contribution, the record also features performances by former drummer Castillo, as well as tracks by new drummer Jon Theodore (ex-The Mars Volta, One Day as a Lion).[67][68] Queens Of The Stone Age premiered a new song \"My God Is The Sun\" at Lollapalooza Brasil on March 30, 2013,[69] a performance in which Theodore made his live debut. The studio version of the song premiered on Lowe's BBC Radio 1 program on April 8, 2013.[70]\n",
            "...Like Clockwork was released on June 3, 2013 on Matador Records in the UK and on June 4 in the United States. Self-produced by the band, it is the first Queens of the Stone Age album to feature full contributions from bassist Michael Shuman and keyboardist and guitarist Dean Fertita. The album debuted in the number one position in the US and is the first QOTSA album to achieve this ranking.[71]\n",
            "Following a performance by QOTSA at the Jay Z-owned Made In America Festival in the summer of 2013, Homme made comments about the rap star during a radio interview with CBC Radio 2's Strombo Show. Homme explained that his band was frisked by the event's security team prior to the performance and referred to Jay Z's personal interaction with the band as a marketing stunt. Homme stated:\n",
            "He has his security frisking the bands on the way in. I just told them if you open up my bag I'm not playing so I guess it's up to you whether we are playing or not ... The idea they frisked all my guys, means you're in some different place, no-one has ever done that [to me] ... He also gave us some champagne and wanted us to take a photo with it. And I thought, \"That's not a gift, that is a marketing tool.\" So I destroyed it. Because I thought it was rude overall. And you shouldn't frisk my guys, you should fuck off.[72]",
            "The ...Like Clockwork tour culminated with a Halloween party at The Forum in Los Angeles, featuring guests such as The Kills, JD McPherson and Nick Oliveri's band Uncontrollable.[73] The band's performance featured an appearance from Oliveri who played songs with them during the encore set, including songs such as \"Auto Pilot\" and \"Quick and to the Pointless\" which had not been performed in a decade.[74]\n"

Keeler had been expected to play bass on the studio recording of the album, but not to tour;[30] however, due to schedule conflicts, he stated he would not be appearing on the album.\n",
            "Era Vulgaris was completed in early April 2007[31] and released June 12, 2007 in the US.[32] The tracks \"Sick, Sick, Sick\" and \"3's & 7's\" were released as singles in early June.[33] Homme has described the record as \"dark, hard, and electrical, sort of like a construction worker.\"[34] When asked about the vocals on the record, specifically the different style of singing that Homme used, he replied:\n",
            "I wanted to try some shit that was downright embarrassing at first. This record is a grower, not about what isn’t there, but what is. ",
            "Bassist Michael Shuman (Wires On Fire, Jubilee and Mini Mansions) and keyboardist Dean Fertita (The Waxwings, The Dead Weather) took over touring duties from Alain Johannes and Natasha Shneider, respectively.[35][36] In July 2007, Van Leeuwen stated the band had written new material, \"still in its infancy\"[37] which Homme later suggested might be released as an EP.[38] Following a subsequent interview with Homme, The Globe and Mail reported that the EP \"could contain as many as 10 B-sides recorded during the Era Vulgaris sessions.\"[39] It was later reported that the EP would not be released due to the record label's unwillingness to put out another QOTSA release at that time.[40]\n",
            "The band began a North American Tour in 2007, which they named the \"Duluth Tour\" because they were going to many small towns and cities they had never played before, such as Duluth, Minnesota.[41] The tour was extended to other areas, such as the United Kingdom, where the band played more shows than on any of their previous UK tours. The band toured in Australia in late March to early April 2008, on the V festival tour, including a string of side shows. Throughout the beginning of May 2008, the band completed the Canadian leg of its touring.[42]\n",
            "In November 2007, Queens of the Stone Age performed a semi-acoustic set in an underground salt mine in Germany, performing a selection of hits, rarities, covers and an unreleased song named \"Cathedral City.\"[43] A DVD of the concert was planned but aside from a trailer promoting the DVD and a number of photographs, no footage of the concert has been released.\n",
            "On July 2, 2008, Queens of the Stone Age's former keyboardist Natasha Shneider died of lung cancer at the age of 52. The news broke with a message posted on the MySpace page of the band Sweethead, of which Natasha's close friend and former bandmate Troy Van Leeuwen is a member. The band's homepage was updated with a memorial message by Homme replacing the normal front page. The band performed a concert in celebration of Natasha Shneider's life at the Henry Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles on August 16, 2008. They were joined on stage by Shneider's husband Alain Johannes, Jack Black and Kyle Gass, Matt Cameron, Brody Dalle, Jesse Hughes, Chris Goss and PJ Harvey, playing a variety of QOTSA and non-QOTSA songs, including covers of songs from bands such as Cream and The Doors. Tenacious D and PJ Harvey also performed acoustic sets at the show. Proceeds from the concert went to defray the costs associated with Natasha's illness.\n",

            "After the breakup of his previous band, Kyuss, in 1995, Josh Homme briefly joined Screaming Trees as a touring guitarist,[4] before deciding to form a new band, Gamma Ray. In 1996 they released the eponymous Gamma Ray EP, featuring \"Born to Hula\" and \"If Only Everything\" (which would later appear on their self-titled debut as \"If Only\"). The EP featured Matt Cameron of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, Van Conner from Screaming Trees, and percussionist Victor Indrizzo.[5]\n",
            "Gamma Ray changed their name in 1997 after the German power metal band Gamma Ray threatened to sue. The name \"Queens of the Stone Age\" came from a nickname given to Kyuss by their producer Chris Goss. Homme said of the name: \"Kings would be too macho. The Kings of the Stone Age wear armor and have axes and wrestle. The Queens of the Stone Age hang out with the Kings of the Stone Age's girlfriends when they wrestle ... Rock should be heavy enough for the boys and sweet enough for the girls. That way everyone's happy and it's more of a party. Kings of the Stone Age is too lopsided.\"[6]\n",
            "The first release under the Queens of the Stone Age name was the song \"18 A.D.,\" released on the compilation album Burn One Up! Music for Stoners which featured members of the Dutch stoner rock band Beaver. The band's first live appearance was on November 20, 1997, at OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington, with Cameron on drums, Mike Johnson of Dinosaur Jr. on bass and John McBain of Monster Magnet on guitar. In December that year, the band released a split EP, Kyuss/Queens of the Stone Age, which featured three tracks from the Gamma Ray sessions as well as three Kyuss tracks recorded in 1995 prior to their breakup.[7]\n",
            "Queens of the Stone Age released their self-titled debut in 1998 on Stone Gossard's and Regan Hagar's label Loosegroove Records, and on vinyl by Man's Ruin Records. Homme played guitar and bass on the album (the latter credited to Homme's alter-ego Carlo Von Sexron), Alfredo Hernández on the drums, and several other contributions by Chris Goss and Hutch. Homme reportedly asked Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan to appear on the record, but he was unable due to other commitments.[8]\n",
            "Soon after the recording sessions were finished for the album, former Kyuss bassist Nick Oliveri joined the group, and touring commenced with a band consisting entirely of ex-Kyuss members. Guitarist Dave Catching joined shortly after. From this point forward, the band's line-up would change frequently; by the time their second album was being recorded, Hernández had left the group to play in other bands.[9]\n"

Joey Castillo played for Eagles of Death Metal on their Heart On tour. Bassist Michael Shuman continued his work as drummer and vocalist with Mini Mansions, while Dean Fertita became the guitarist/keyboardist for Jack White's newest group, The Dead Weather. Josh Homme formed supergroup Them Crooked Vultures with Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones.[45] After Them Crooked Vultures finished touring in June, the band toured and released a two-CD deluxe edition of Rated R on August 3, 2010. This edition featured the original CD along with six B-sides and live recordings from the band's Reading performance in 2000.\n",
            "In 2010, Homme suffered from complications during a botched knee surgery, during which his heart stopped for a short time due to asphyxiation; doctors had to use a defibrillator to revive him. Following this, he was bedridden for four months and plunged into a deep depression, during which he considered giving up his music career altogether.[46] He elaborated on this experience further in an interview on Marc Maron's WTF podcast, explaining that he had contracted a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection which his immune system could not fight due to stress. Homme has since said that the experience contributed greatly to the writing and recording of ...Like Clockwork.[47]\n",
            "After Homme recovered, Queens of the Stone Age released a remastered version of their self-titled debut album in early 2011, and performed the album in its entirety in a promotional tour.[48] The band performed on Conan on April 14,[49] and later played at the Australian music festival Soundwave.[32] Throughout the summer of 2011, the band appeared at various European festivals, including the Glastonbury Festival, in Somerset, UK. They also played at Pearl Jam's 20th Anniversary Festival at Alpine Valley in East Troy, WI on September 3 and 4, 2011, which would be their last with drummer Joey Castillo.\n"

Despite Lanegan reportedly turning down an invitation to remain with the band, he recorded vocals on new tracks (notably the solo vocalist on the opening track \"This Lullaby\") and appeared on the supporting tour as scheduling and his health permitted.\n",

In 2005, the group supported Nine Inch Nails on their North American tour of With Teeth along with Autolux (for the first half of the tour) and Death from Above 1979 (for the second). NIN's guitarist Aaron North appeared as an onstage guest with the Queens for the songs \"Born to Hula,\" \"Regular John,\" \"Avon,\" \"Monsters in the Parasol\" and \"Long, Slow Goodbye\" at the Wiltern LG in Los Angeles on December 19 and 20 2005.\n",

As a special encore they performed three Kyuss songs: \"Thumb,\" \"Hurricane\" and \"Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoop.\"[22] Homme stated that the band's lowest point was during the Lullabies era,[23] but that the record \"took the lead jacket off\" the band following the firing of Oliveri in 2004.[24]\n"

            "The album garnered positive reviews and received a lot more attention than their debut, despite the fact that the lyrics to \"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\" were deemed by mega-retailer Wal-Mart to promote drug use, almost causing the record to get pulled from store shelves.[11] The success of the record also earned the band notable opening slots with The Smashing Pumpkins, Foo Fighters, Hole, and a place at Ozzfest 2000.[10] It was during this time that Homme stated:\n",
            "There's a robotic element to our albums, like the repetition of riffs. We also wanted to do a record that had a lot of dynamic range. We wanted to set it up in this band so we could play anything. We don't want to get roped in by our own music. If anyone has a good song (regardless of style) we should be able to play it.",

This one added that we’re different and weird.\"[15] The band continued to experiment on their third album, Songs for the Deaf, which also featured a line-up including three lead vocalists, many guest appearances and wide range of instrumentation, including horn and string sections.[97] Homme has described Lullabies to Paralyze as a \"dark\" album, which includes imagery inspired by The Brothers Grimm folk and fairy tales.[98] In 2005, Homme explained, \"Where the poetry seems to be is when you start in the dark and reach for the light—that's what makes it not depressing to me...\"[99] The album changed gears from the band's previous distinct \"driving\" sound, much due to the departure of longtime member Nick Oliveri.[15] The band almost exclusively used semi hollow body guitars during the making of the record.[100] With Era Vulgaris the band continued to develop their signature sound with more dance-oriented elements and electronic influences, while Homme has currently gone back to being the only lead vocalist in the band[101] and uses more distinct vocal melodies.[102]\n",
         "Homme has on numerous occasions described their music as \"rock versions of electronic music,\" stating that he takes inspiration from the repetitive nature of electronic trance music along with various forms of dance music, hip hop, trip hop and Krautrock. This heavy rock style mixed with the structure of electronic music has been dubbed by Homme as \"robot rock\" in an interview with KUNO-TV at the Roskilde Festival 2001.[citation needed]\n",
         "Homme has described aspects of his distinctive guitar playing style.[103] He demonstrated the 'Josh Homme scale', which he claimed was the result of years playing and altering the blues scale. The scale has the intervals 1, b3, 3, b5, 5, 6, b7. His scale is the half whole scale with the second degree (b2) omitted.[104] In the same interview Homme referenced some of his earlier influences on his playing, citing both polka guitar styles and the techniques of Jimi Hendrix.\n"

         "Queens of the Stone Age (commonly abbreviated QOTSA) is an American rock band formed in 1996 in Palm Desert, California. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist Josh Homme, who has been the only constant member throughout multiple line-up changes. The current line-up consists of Homme alongside Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar, lap steel, keyboard, percussion, backing vocals), Michael Shuman (bass guitar, keyboard, backing vocals), Dean Fertita (keyboards, guitar, percussion, backing vocals), and Jon Theodore (drums, percussion). The band also have a large pool of contributors and collaborators.[1] Queens of the Stone Age are known for their blues, Krautrock and electronica-influenced style of riff-oriented and rhythmic hard rock music, coupled with Homme's distinct falsetto vocals and unorthodox guitar scales. \n",
         "Formed after the dissolution of Homme's previous band Kyuss,[2] the band originated from the Palm Desert music scene, known for its distinct \"desert rock\" sound and highly collaborative nature. Their self-titled debut album was recorded by former Kyuss bandmates Alfredo Hernández on drums and Homme on all other instruments. It was well received by critics for its stoner rock sound which Homme has described as \"robot rock\". Nick Oliveri joined the band as bassist and vocalist along with additional vocalist Mark Lanegan for the recording of Rated R, which was commercially and critically successful. Now with three singers and a myriad of other collaborators, Rated R diversified their musical palette with forays into psychedelic rock, punk rock and heavy metal, and featured their breakout single \"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\", which lists six recreational drugs. Featuring former Nirvana drummer and Foo Fighters singer Dave Grohl on drums and contributions from Alain Johannes and Natasha Shneider, Songs for the Deaf was released in 2002, to universal acclaim and commercial success. The album saw the band further experiment with instrumentation, such as string and horn arrangements, and featured some of the band's most enduring singles \"No One Knows\" and \"Go with the Flow\". By this time the band had achieved considerable international recognition, and have since embarked on successive world tours. Homme fired Oliveri and Lanegan left as a core member but continued to occasionally contribute vocals, making Homme the primary singer for 2005's Lullabies to Paralyze and 2007's electronic-influenced Era Vulgaris. \n",
         "After a few years of inactivity while the band members worked on other projects, the more somber and introspective ...Like Clockwork was released in 2013, receiving critical acclaim. The band released Villains in 2017 with Mark Ronson as producer.[1]\n",
         "The band have been nominated for Grammy Awards seven times; four times for Best Hard Rock Performance, twice for Best Rock Album, and once for Best Rock Performance.[3]\n"
