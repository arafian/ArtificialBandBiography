         "Phantom Tollbooth was a post-punk/noise rock band from New York City.[1] They played a style of post punk that included elements from jazz,[2] noise rock, and art rock.[1][3] This allowed Phantom Tollbooth to make sudden starts, stops, and tempo changes in their music.[4]  All of their albums were released in a four-year window between 1984 and 1988 on Homestead Records. In 2003, Guided by Voices frontman Robert Pollard created new lyrics and melodies for Phantom Tollbooth's 1988 album Power Toy.[3] The resulting work was released as Beard of Lightning.[5]\n"
