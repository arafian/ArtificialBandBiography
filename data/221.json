         "The band is known for its hard driving playing and high lonesome family harmonies. Some of the band's biggest influences are Jimmy Martin, Flatt & Scruggs, The Stanley Brothers, The Osbourne Brothers, The McPeak Brothers, The Country Gentlemen, and The Seldom Scene. The style of music they play makes them a favorite at bluegrass festivals. They are known for putting on one of the most electrifying shows on the festival circuit. Many times they are put on in the festival closing slot due to the high number of encores demanded by the audience.\n"
