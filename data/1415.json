         "Band members Michael Ian Cummings, from Boston, and Noah Rubin, of Los Angeles, were located in the Los Angeles area when they began making music together as singer and drummer of The Dead Trees.[1][2] In 2012, Cummings and Rubin began sending demos back and forth to London to future member Joshua Hubbard, who then had played guitar for The Paddingtons and Dirty Pretty Things. The three men eventually met in Manhattan to form the band. They set out to produce an art magazine, YONKS, and record their EP Schemers. YONKS is a publication that features the band's new music and focuses on showcasing talented artists and photographers.[3] Cummings now sings for the band, Rubin plays the drums, and Hubbard plays guitar.[4] Other musicians, Dan Burke and Tommy Allen, are permanent and contributing members of the Skaters team.[2] The name Skaters was chosen because it reminds the members of their youth and culture of skating.[5] The band claims to have been musically influenced by “the melodic punk bands of the 70’s and 80’s like Mission of Burma, Devo, and The Cars”, as well as The Ramones, The Clash, and The Pixies.[6] Skaters is currently managed by Nick Bobetsky of Red Light Management.[7]\n"
