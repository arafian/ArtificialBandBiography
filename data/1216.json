            "Kitten was formed in 2009. Front woman Chloe Chaidez formed the band after meeting producer Chad Anderson, with whom she developed a professional relationship. Anderson would become the manager of Kitten, and contribute as a producer and songwriter for the band.[10][25] Kitten's first guitarist, Max Ratsky, introduced Chaidez to the other musicians who would join Kitten's original lineup.[26] These fellow founding members were drummer Max Kuehn, keyboardist Elvis Kuehn, and guitarist Andy Miller.[27] Ratsky left Kitten in 2009; prior to the release of their debut extended play, which the band had begun working on that year.[28]\n",
            "In 2010, Kitten were signed to Atlantic Records,[12] and bassist Zac Carper joined the band.[29] Various demos were shared by the band in the lead-up to their upcoming EP, such as \"We Did It Anyway\", \"Don't Kill the Light\", and \"Johnny Johnny Johnny\".[30][31] The final version of \"Don't Kill the Light\", renamed \"Kill the Light\", was shared as a free download in March 2010.[32] Kitten's debut extended play, Sunday School, was released in October 2010.[33] The following November, the track \"Kill the Light\" was released as a single on 7\" vinyl.[34]\n",
            "In December 2010, Kitten began working on a planned full-length album.[35][36] By early 2011, they had recruited bassist Chris Vogel as a new band member.[37] The band ultimately decided to release five of their new songs as an extended play; planning to combine EP tracks and other new material into an album later on.[38]\n",
            "Kitten recorded a cover of \"Panic\" by The Smiths in 2011, which they contributed to the tribute album Please Please Please: A Tribute to The Smiths.[39][40]\n",
            "To promote their upcoming EP, the band released two singles in 2012: the double single \"Cut It Out\" / \"Sugar\" in May, and \"Japanese Eyes\" in July.[41][42] The EP, titled Cut It Out, was released on August 28, 2012 through Atlantic Records.[43][44] Chaidez described its sound as being more electronic, while still containing the \"rock element\" of their previous EP.[45] The new sound was the result of Chaidez experimenting with electronic music production using Ableton, and the influence of 80s new wave music.[46][47]\n",
            "Following the release of Cut It Out, Kitten went through major lineup changes. Band members Max Kuehn, Elvis Kuehn, and Zac Carper left Kitten to focus on their other band, FIDLAR.[10] Later in 2012, Kitten recruited three new members—drummer Lukas Frank, keyboardist Bryan DeLeon, and guitarist Waylon Rector—and Andy Miller and Chris Vogel left the band.[48] By early 2013, Kitten had also gained a new bassist, Zach Bilson.[49][50]\n"

            "In February 2013, Kitten shared a new song titled \"Yesterday (What's Love)\".[49] The following August, they shared the track \"Like a Stranger\" to promote their upcoming extended play of the same name. They revealed at the same time that their debut album was scheduled for 2014.[51] The Like a Stranger EP was released on August 27, 2013 through Elektra Records.[52]\n",
            "Later in 2013, following the release of Like a Stranger, band members Waylon Rector, Lukas Frank, Zach Bilson, and Bryan DeLeon chose to leave Kitten. [53] In February 2014, Rector, Bilson, and DeLeon rejoined the band, joining Chaidez on tour supporting The Neighbourhood.[54][55]\n",
            "Kitten premiered a new track, \"Money\", along with its music video in February 2014. The video stars musician Ariel Pink. Chaidez stated that, while recording their debut album, the band had ideas for music that did not fit the album's sound. They decided to release some of these tracks, including \"Money\", as a separate project. According to Chaidez, the songs were inspired by \"old Missy Elliot, Arca, Drake, Future, Yeezus, etc.\"[56] This project emerged as a seven-track mixtape titled MXTP, which was released on May 13, 2014. It was available to stream exclusively via Beats Music.[57] That same month, Rector, Bilson, and DeLeon left the band again, leaving Chaidez as the sole remaining member of Kitten.[58][59]\n",
            "Kitten's eponymous debut album, Kitten, was released on June 24, 2014 by Elektra Records.[17] It is composed both of new music and songs from the band's earlier extended plays.[3] The album was preceded by two singles: \"Why I Wait\" and \"G#\";[60][61] the latter originally appeared on Kitten's 2012 EP Cut It Out. To celebrate the album's release, Kitten held a record release party at El Rey Theatre, Los Angeles.[62] This show commenced the band's first headlining tour, which included dates in the United States and Canada.[63][64]\n",
            "In March 2015, Kitten shared a new track titled \"Big Dope Baby\" via SoundCloud. The song saw Chaidez experiment with a more punk sound.[65] Also in 2015, Kitten sold a compilation CD titled Diamonds on tour. It included various songs from their earlier releases, as well as four previously unreleased tracks (\"Michael\", \"Catholic Boyz\", \"Hot Rod\", and \"Running Away\") and new remixes of the songs \"Sugar\" and \"Like a Stranger\".[66]\n"

            "As of 2016, Kitten had left Elektra Records, opting to go independent.[13] In January 2016, the band released a new single, \"Fall on Me\", and announced an upcoming EP titled Heaven or Somewhere in Between.[67] The EP was released independently on March 4, 2016.[68] It largely focuses on spiritual themes; according to Chaidez, \"a lot of the lyrics have to do with the relationship between you and whatever your God is and how that plays out into your life\".[69] Chaidez worked on the songs with a new collaborator, Dave Stagno, as well as a long-time collaborator, producer Chad Anderson. Stagno played keyboards on the EP, but would go on to join Kitten as a guitarist.[13][11] Heaven or Somewhere in Between was ranked seventeenth in Rolling Stone's list of \"20 Best Pop Albums of 2016\".[19] In July 2016, Kitten released a new single titled \"Steal the Night\".[70] The song appears as a bonus track on the vinyl release of Heaven or Somewhere in Between, along with a \"piano version\" of \"Fall on Me\".[71]\n",
            "In August 2016, Kitten began a crowdfunding campaign through the website PledgeMusic to fund their planned second album.[72] The band shared two new songs in February 2017: \"No Hallelujah\" and \"Oh My God\".[73][74] Both songs were made available to download via PledgeMusic, exclusively for \"Pledgers\".[75][76]\n",
            "In 2017–2018, Kitten gained several new members to their lineup. Guitarist Parker Silzer IV and keyboardist Max Tsiring joined the band in January 2017,[77][11] after being introduced to Chaidez by Stagno.[78] The following September, Kitten reconnected with musician Blu DeTiger—who had opened for the band in 2015[79]—on the set of the music video for \"Phases\" by Alma and French Montana.[80] Kitten also met DeTiger's brother Rex on the set. Blu and Rex DeTiger soon joined Kitten as the band's touring bassist and touring drummer, respectively.[78][81][82][11]\n",

It is their first project to be entirely self-produced by the band. Its lyrics, according to Chaidez, \"mostly deal with personal relationships and mostly from a position of newfound strength\".[20]\n",
            "In August 2018, Kitten released a new single titled \"Secrets\", along with its B-side \"Mercury\".[86] \"Mercury\" was written about Chaidez' parents' divorce.[87] A new version of their song \"Oh My God\" was released as a single in October 2018.[88]\n"
