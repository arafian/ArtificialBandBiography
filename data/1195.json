         "On August 4, 2008, the band posted a blog on their MySpace page signaling the end of Grade 8, stating \"I think we are just ready to do other things, and we wanted to leave Grade 8 the way it was, not change the sound.\". The blog goes on to state that they had started a new project called \"The Kill Generation\", although nothing has been heard of the project since the blog was posted.\n"
