      "Justifide is an American rock band from Chandler, Arizona, founded in 1999. The band consists of Jason Moncivaiz (vocals, drums), Sambo Moncivaiz (bass), and Joey Avalos (guitar). The band has seen success in Christian rock circles, and they have released two albums: Life Outside The Toy Box (2001) and The Beauty of the Unknown (2002). \n",
      "On December 11, 2014, Justifide announced a reunion and a new album, The Vault Sessions, which is scheduled to release in summer 2015.\n",
      "The history of Justifide began at home with the brokenness of distressed family relations, and that eventually led to experiments with alcohol and other drugs.  While they were only in their teens, the Moncivaiz brothers lived in a house that was stressed to the breaking point, with the parents separated.  This started to spiral downward, and would have ended up much worse.  Fortunately, convinced of the family's need for God, the Moncivaiz father became born again.  This changed lives of those in the family.  Music was a natural outlet for the family, as both brothers started learning instruments at a young age.\n"
