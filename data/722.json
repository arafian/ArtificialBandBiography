      "Princess Princess (プリンセス・プリンセス, Purinsesu Purinsesu, commonly referred to as Puri-Puri) was a five-piece Japanese rock/pop girl band active from 1983 to 1996. They previously released music under the names \"Julian Mama\" (ジュリアン・ママ, Jurian Mama) and \"Akasaka Komachi\" (赤坂小町).\n",
      "After being assembled via open audition of 1400 hopefuls as the female music group Akasaka Komachi by TDK Records in 1983, the band was housed with their manager in the Tokyo suburb of Nishi-Nippori for over two years to develop their musical skills and experience. In March 1984, the band made the first of several appearances on Japanese television. In 1985 the band transferred from TDK Records to another management company, changed their name to Julian Mama, but did not release any singles or albums.\n",
      "In May 1986, the band made their recording debut with the EP Kiss de Crime, released by CBS Sony. In August 1986, the band transferred their management to Shinko Music Entertainment. In May of that year the CEO of Shinko had declined to represent the band, but the company employee Emiko Ichimura, who had seen the girls' live show and believed in their success, eventually persuaded the company to take them on. The band made seven concert appearances in 1986, playing in very small venues around Tokyo.\n"
