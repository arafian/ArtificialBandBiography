      "Blindside is a Swedish post-hardcore band from the southern suburbs of Stockholm, Sweden. They formed in Stockholm in 1994 as Underfree. In 1996, they changed their name to Blindside and released the Blindside album in 1997 through Swedish independent record company Day-Glo Records.  Another album, A Thought Crushed My Mind, came out in 2000. The group received greater attention in 2001 when they toured with P.O.D., resulting in a contract with Elektra. In 2002 they released the album Silence and in 2003 they toured in support of Hoobastank. A 2004 headlining tour suffered equipment theft but then Blindside released About a Burning Fire. Losing support from their label, the next year Blindside released The Great Depression independently, and they put out the DVD Ten Years Running Blind.\n",
      "Blindside independently released another EP in 2007 – The Black Rose – but then they ceased most band activity until 2011 when they released With Shivering Hearts We Wait.\n",
      "Blindside was formed in 1994 by the original line up. In 1997, Blindside debuted in Sweden with their self-titled debut, a collection of old and new songs that were based on singer Christian Lindskog's life at the time. In 1998 Blindside released the Empty Box EP on Day-Glo Records as a follow up to their self-titled debut. In 1997, Tooth & Nail Records got a hold of their debut album and signed a licensing deal with Blindside.  The US debut was released later that year by Tooth & Nail and featured songs both from the Swedish full-length debut and from the EP Empty Box. In 2000, A Thought Crushed My Mind was released.  A Thought Crushed My Mind was more harsh and hardcore than the band's debut, and vocalist/chief lyricist Christian Lindskog also voiced his pain of missing his wife, Elina, while touring.  It would be Blindside's final album with Solid State. Fellow group P.O.D. began actively endorsing Blindside and signed them to Elektra Records under the imprint 3 Points.\n"
