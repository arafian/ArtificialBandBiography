         "This Patch of Sky were an Oregon instrumental post rock band, formed in 2010 in Eugene. The band typically composed cinematic instrumental pieces that combine subtle-nuanced melodies and wall-of-sound guitars to create a symphonic landscape.  The band was signed to German indie label Oxide-Tones in 2011 and released \"The Immortal, The Invisible\" and \"Newly Risen, How Brightly You Shine\".  In 2013 Oxide-Tones became extinct, resulting in the band releasing full-length album \"Heroes and Ghosts\" independently.  In August 2014, the band released a full length self-titled album independently. In September 2017, the band signed with Graphic Nature Records, an imprint of Equal Vision Records and released a full length \"These Small Spaces\". In September 2019, they disbanded. \n",
