      "With the Grapes of Wrath name and song catalogue tied up in legal wrangling between Kane and the remainder of the band, Jones and the Hooper brothers adopted the name Ginger. They released a self-titled EP under that name in 1993, with session players Lanny Hussey and Sean Ashby adding extra guitars.\n"
