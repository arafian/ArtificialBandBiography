      "The Police Scotland Fife Pipe Band is a Grade 1 pipe band from Fife in Scotland, established in September 2007.\n",
      "The band was established in September 2007 as the Fife Constabulary Pipe Band, and was placed in the senior grade by the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association in February the following year. Their first competition, at the Dunbar Highland Games in May 2008, saw them awarded first prize. In August of the same year they made their first appearance at the World Pipe Band Championships and gained entry into the grade one final, having achieved second place among fourteen bands in the morning qualifying round.\n",
      "The first Pipe Major was James Murray, with Andrew Mathieson starting as Pipe Sergeant, both having left Grade 1 band Shotts and Dykehead. When James Murray announced he was to emigrate to Australia, Mathieson took over as Pipe Major. Douglas Murray became Pipe Major in July 2013 after Andrew Mathieson stepped down, citing time constraints as a result of increasing family commitments and his work with the junior band.\n"
