         "Heisenflei and Smollin met in high school, where they sang in choir together.  In 2004 they recorded their first music on a digital 8-track recorder in Heisenflei's studio apartment in Silverlake, California.  Their first self-release was The EP (produced by Noah Shain) in 2006; champions of the environment, Heisenflei and Smollin folded and glued 750 CD sleeves made out of recycled cereal boxes.  Their second self-released EP, Orgy Porgy (produced by Stevehimself) was recorded at Moonshine Studios.  The group used recycled billboard vinyl to create 1,000 CD jackets which were hand sewn and screen printed with six unique images by artist Ronald Dzerigian.[2]\n",
