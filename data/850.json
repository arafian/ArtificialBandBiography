      "The Chantays, sometimes credited as Chantay's, is an American surf rock band from Orange County, California, United States, known for the hit instrumental \"Pipeline\" (1963). Their music combines electronic keyboards and surf guitar, creating a unique ghostly sound.\n",
      "The Chantays were formed in 1961 by five high-school friends. Bob Spickard, Brian Carman (co-writers of \"Pipeline\"), Bob Welch, Warren Waters and Rob Marshall were all students at Santa Ana High School in California. In December 1962, the group recorded and released \"Pipeline\", which peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 1963. The track also peaked in the UK Singles Chart in 1963 at No. 16. The Chantays recorded their first album in 1963, also titled Pipeline, which included \"Blunderbus\" and \"El Conquistador\". Their follow-up album was Two Sides of the Chantays in 1964.\n",
      "The Chantays toured Japan and the United States, joining the Righteous Brothers and Roy Orbison on a few occasions, and they were the only rock and roll band to perform on The Lawrence Welk Show.\n"
