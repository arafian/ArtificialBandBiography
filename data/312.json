         "The band was launched by vocalist Thomas Anselmi and guitarist Christian Thorvaldson, former members of the short-lived and controversial punk rock band Slow,[1] with new bassist Eric Marxsen and drummer Pete Bourne.\nThe band was formed in 1987,[2] when Anselmi and Thorvaldson settled on that name after having collaborated under the short-lived band names Mo and Christian Thorvaldson's Freeze-Dried Dog since the demise of Slow.[2]\n",
         "Initially, the band spelled its name as the symbol ©, pronounced as \"Circle C\".[3] Under that name, they released a self-titled debut album via Geffen Records in 1991.[4] That album sold poorly, and the band was dropped from Geffen. \n",
         "After a few years of struggling to continue in the music industry, they were signed to BMG Music, releasing their second album Love Story in 1996 under the name Copyright.[5] The singles \"Transfiguration\" and \"Radio\" were released from that album. Love Story was a shortlisted Juno Award nominee for Best Alternative Album at the Juno Awards of 1998.[6]\n",
         "The album The Hidden World followed in 2001, with the song \"Rock Machine\" being released as a single. The band disbanded not long after.[7]\n"
