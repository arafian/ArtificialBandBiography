         "Audrye Sessions was founded in 2002 by singer Ryan Karazija, who was later joined by Alicia Marie Campbell.[1] Soon after, Michael Knox joined the band through a Craigslist ad. They began playing coffeehouses in their hometown of Livermore, California. In a San Francisco Chronicle profile, they described themselves as having a \"very Brit-rock feel like The Beatles meet Muse.\"[2] The band has been compared to Muse, Coldplay, Oasis, Radiohead, and The Verve.[3][4][5][6]\n",
         "In 2007 they won a spot on Live 105's BFD summer concert, and played at San Francisco's Noise Pop and Austin's SXSW music festivals. Their final line-up consisted of Karazija, Campbell, Knox, and James Leste. Musicians who also performed or toured with Audrye Sessions include violinist Anton Patzner and drummer Alex Feldman.\n",
         "They released a self-titled Audrye Sessions EP in October 2008 through Black Seal, a unit of RCA Records. The band's self-titled full-length album was released on February 17, 2009.[7] In the fall of 2009, they recorded \"Turn Me Off\" in Simlish. The song was later featured in The Sims 3: World Adventures, the first expansion pack for The Sims 3.[8]\n",
