      "Beefy Red was an American, San Francisco Bay Area music band (1969–1972) based in Marin County, California, United States, which played at various Bay Area venues, including Bill Graham's Fillmore West from October 22–25 in 1970. Beefy Red performed frequently at San Anselmo's 'The Lion's Share', a club often cited as one of the most historic in the history of the Marin County music scene. The group was most noted for playing \"swinging R&B\"  but played other syles like blues and jazz.\n",
      "In 2008 Beefy Red was included by Paul Liberatore, of the Marin Independent Journal, on a list of potential nominees for a proposed 'Marin Music Museum'.\n",
      "Members included later solo recording artist and film composer Mark Isham on trumpet and soprano saxophone, and Barry Finnerty on electric guitar and some lead vocals, who was later a performing/recording artist with Miles Davis, the Crusaders and the Brecker Brothers among many others. Finnerty, as the group's arranger, also wrote horn charts for the band.\n"
