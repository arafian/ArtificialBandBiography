      "Haunted Garage is a horror punk/heavy metal band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1985. Fronted by B-movie actor Dukey Flyswatter, the band is known for their campy science fiction and horror movie-inspired songs and elaborately bloody and prop-filled stage shows.\n",
      "The original incarnation of Haunted Garage lasted from 1985 to 1993, with several one-off reunions featuring varying line-ups occurring afterwards. As of 2013, a new version of the band is currently active with Flyswatter as the only remaining original member.\n",
      "Haunted Garage was formed in 1985 by vocalist Dukey Flyswatter (stage name of Michael Sonye), bassist Ace McCoomba and guitarist Nyck Varoom. Initially, the band started out in a psychedelic/rockabilly style, playing covers of theme songs from vintage B movies (\"You know, 'The South Is Gonna Rise Again' from Two Thousand Maniacs!, and 'Hideous Sun Demon' and 'The Blob' and stuff like that\", according to Flyswatter) before eventually writing original material in a similar B movie-inspired vein. Following the addition of transvestite lead guitarist Gaby Godhead and drummer Stiff Slug, Haunted Garage's sound evolved into a more aggressive fusion of horror punk and heavy metal, a mix which the Los Angeles Times described as \"The Dickies doing Alice Cooper\" but which Flyswatter referred to as \"splatter punk\".\n"
