The song “Five Steps” from the album Speaking of The Davenports is the theme song to the A&E television series Intervention.\n",
      "After performing with Fountains of Wayne co-founder Chris Collingwood in the band “Smalltown Criers,” Scott Klass formed The Davenports.  In 2000 the band released their first album Speaking of The Davenports to positive reviews.  Allmusic described the album as having “taken subtle college power pop to an infinitely pleasing level.”  MTV licensed music from the record for the shows “Undressed” and “The Sausage Factory.”\n",
      "The band’s follow-up recording Hi-Tech Lowlife was released in 2005 again to positive reviews.  Popmatters described the record as “subtle power pop at its most pleasant,” while AllMusic critic Jason Damas cited the band as “ some of the most lyrically and musically rich modern guitar-pop.”\n"
