         "The band was formed when Welsh-born Matthew Hitt moved to New York City in 2011 to pursue a career in modelling. With a degree in English Literature, he found time to \"write and jam on [his] guitar every day\".[1] He recruited three musicians and began rehearsing and recording the songs.[6] Guitarist Jack Ridley is originally from the North West of the US while bass player Erik Snyder grew up outside Philadelphia.[7] On February 4, 2013, Drowners released their first EP Between Us Girls on the English label Birthday Records. The EP contains three short songs, including \"Long Hair\", oft cited as the lead track.[1]\n",
         "The band signed with a Frenchkiss Records, and began to record their first studio album in May 2013. The album was produced by Gus Oberg and Johnny T, while recording took place over a three-week period.[8] It received mixed reviews.[9]\n",
         "The band headed to Europe for the first time in February 2014 in support of their album, to perform a small number of London shows (including an in-store performance at Rough Trade East), and supported Cage The Elephant on their European tour and SKATERS on their UK tour.[10] The band enlisted several drummers, including Joe Brodie,[7] before settling on Daniel Jacobs.[11]\n",
         "The band opened shows for Arctic Monkeys, The Vaccines and Foals while undertaking their first headlining tour of North America and Europe in February/March 2014.[12] They later performed at the Coachella festival and supported Temples.[8] After two months of recording, the band had finalised their second album by Christmas 2015.[13]\n",
