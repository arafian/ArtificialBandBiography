Guitarist Jack Ridley is originally from the North West of the US while bass player Erik Snyder grew up outside Philadelphia. On February 4, 2013, Drowners released their first EP Between Us Girls on the English label Birthday Records. The EP contains three short songs, including \"Long Hair\", oft cited as the lead track.\n",
