Their third album, Animal, was produced by Kurt Ballou of Converge and released in October 2007.[4] They have also toured Europe with Converge and Belgian hardcore/punk band Rise and Fall. Animosity disbanded officially after nearly a year of non-activity in October 2009. The band's frontman Leo Miller stated that their \"musical and experiential goals have been exceeded\" and: \"If you haven't gotten enough of Animosity, please rest assured that we have.\"[5]\n"
