         "Communiqué was an indie rock band from the San Francisco Bay Area. The band originated as American Steel, but decided to record under the name Communiqué during the taping of A Crescent Honeymoon in 2002 because the synth-rock sound did not match the punk style of American Steel. In 2004, they released \"Poison Arrows\". In 2007, the \"Communiqué\" name was discontinued, with the members becoming American Steel again. \n"
