            "After the release of Anthrax's debut album Fistful of Metal, bassist Dan Lilker, a founding member of the group, was fired by the band. He decided to pursue a more aggressive style of music and formed Nuclear Assault with guitarist/vocalist John Connelly,[3] who had been involved in an early version of Anthrax.[citation needed] They were joined by guitarist Mike Bogush and drummer Scott Duboys (later of Cities, Cycle Sluts From Hell and Warrior Soul).[3] They then recorded the first of two demos, which included the songs \"Stranded in Hell\", \"The Plague\", and \"Hang the Pope\".[citation needed]\n",
            "The group's first live performance was at the Union Jack in South River, New Jersey in late 1984.[citation needed] Guitarist Mike Bogush was later replaced by Anthony Bramante.[3] Bramante's first live performance with the group was at L'Amour in Brooklyn, New York in April 1985.[citation needed] Shortly after the performance, Duboys left the band and was replaced by drummer Glenn Evans formerly of New Jersey-based band T.T. Quick.[3]\n"

            "The second demo Live Suffer Die was recorded and the band began touring the United States consistently. The band signed a multi-album contract with Combat Records and recorded the Game Over album in April 1986, released to critical acclaim later that year.[citation needed] Game Over was followed by an extended play called The Plague, which was released to coincide with a 1987 European tour with Agent Steel and Atomkraft.[4] Later, feeling constrained by their contract with Combat, the band signed with I.R.S. Records and recorded Survive in 1988.[5] The album reached number 145 on the US Billboard 200 chart[6] and Nuclear Assault set off on a 180-day world tour[4] in the United States and Europe; first as an opening act for Slayer and later headlining with British group Acid Reign as a support act.[7] The next album, 1989's Handle with Care, would see the band at their commercial peak, hitting the US chart at number 126,[6] and peaking in the UK Albums Chart at No. 60,[8] with more touring, including a trip to Japan and a U.S. tour opening for Testament and Savatage.[4] The band released their first live album, Live at the Hammersmith Odeon, in 1990,[3] but internal troubles were causing problems for the band.[9]\n"

Founding member Dan Lilker departed to concentrate on Brutal Truth and longtime guitarist Anthony Bramante followed by the end of the year.[citation needed]\n",

         "Nuclear Assault is an American thrash metal band formed in New York City in 1984. Part of the mid-to-late 1980s thrash metal movement, they were one of the main bands of the genre to emerge from the East Coast along with Overkill, Whiplash, Toxik, Carnivore, and Anthrax;[1] the latter was co-founded by Nuclear Assault bassist Dan Lilker, who left Anthrax shortly after the release of their first album. Nuclear Assault released five full-length albums and toured relentlessly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, and broke up in 1995. The band reunited briefly in 1997 and then permanently in 2002.\n",
         "Nuclear Assault has released six studio albums to date, the latest being Third World Genocide (2005). Their most successful records are Survive (1988) and Handle with Care (1989), which peaked at #145 and #126 on the Billboard 200 chart respectively.[2]\n"
