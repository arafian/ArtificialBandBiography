            "Alex and Alan knew each other from high school, where they wrote songs together. Following a several year hiatus, in which Alex recorded some tracks as a rapper and Alan continued to hone his producing skills, they recorded a short EP as Goodnight Moon, but it was never released.   Shortly after completing that CD, Alex and Alan formed Goodnight Medic along with Matt Vink, Brad Fry and Mark Sawatzky. Goodnight Medic placed in the top 10 of the 2008 Fox Seeds contest, but broke up in February 2009 via a Facebook announcement, stating \"We will be back again in the form of something great and new.\"[4] Following the departure of Brad and Mark, Alex, Alan, and Matt formed a new group, recruiting guitarist Joe Porter.
