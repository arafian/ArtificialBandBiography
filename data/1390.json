            "The band formed in the summer of 1993 after Palumbo and Beck met each other at camp. Of the band name, Beck has said: \"We had a list of names, and we were just like, let's pick one of these band names which ones the coolest. At the time there were a bunch of bands coming out with two names in one like that, like mouthpiece, curbjaw, stuff like that. We were going down the list, and the first name that I liked was Swiftkick. I'm all like, that’s a sick name. But for some reason Glassjaw stuck. There's really no reason behind it; it just sounded cool.\"[4] The band played their first show in 1994 in Oceanside, NY. In the early days, Beck and Weinstock were also playing with Jewish straight edge metalcore band, Sons of Abraham. Sons of Abraham constitute an important influence on Glassjaw, songs such as \"Hurting and Shoving (She Should Have Let Me Sleep)\" by Glassjaw drawing particularly on earlier Sons of Abraham releases. Palumbo was in his own straight-edge band called XbustedX. The group's line-up changed constantly in their early years while they played in the local New York hardcore scene. Beck's primary instrument throughout this time was drums, but switched to bass guitar when Ariel Telford left the band in 1998, and then switched to lead guitar when Kris Baldwin left and Manuel Carrero joined the band in 1999. From 1994-1999 the band did several demo recordings of some songs that would eventually appear on their official releases, as well as several other compositions that would not see official release. The band recorded the five-song Kiss Kiss Bang Bang EP in 1997. The record was released independently on the label 2 Cents a Pop, and saw a re-release in 2001 without label affiliation.  The line-up on this record was Daryl Palumbo, Justin Beck, Todd Weinstock, Kris Baldwin and Ariel Telford. \"Star Above My Bed\", from the EP, is still in the band's set lists to this day. A significant recording came in 1999 working with Don Fury (Quicksand, Snapcase, Orange 9mm, The Hearing Aides), showcasing songs that appeared on their debut LP Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence.\n"

            "In 1999, the band entered the studio at Indigo Ranch in Malibu, California, with producer Ross Robinson (At the Drive-In, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, among others) to record their first full-length album titled Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence, which saw release in 2000 through Roadrunner Records. On being signed, guitarist Justin Beck said: \"Ross showed up at a practice, we start a song; 5-4-3-2-1. Ross stands up, waving his hands and he's like, 'It's over, it's done. I want to do this, you've got a deal!'[5] The line-up on this record was Palumbo, Beck, Todd Weinstock, Manuel Carrero & Sammy Siegler (who left the band prior to the subsequent tour). Robinson has said of it: \"Our goal at the time of that record was to destroy Adidas rock\",[6] a self-deprecating reference to the Adidas-sponsored bands (Korn, Limp Bizkit) Robinson had produced and championed as part of the nu-metal movement.[7] The music was aggressive and unrelenting, but also included spacious songs like \"When One Eight Becomes Two Zeros\", \"Her Middle Name is Boom\", \"Piano\" and the epic \"Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence\", the latter of which deals with Palumbo's problems with Crohn's disease.[5] The music, accompanied with Palumbo's lyrics—which were often bitter and resentful towards particular characters he was discussing—and his singing style in itself—powerful and aggressive guttural screaming along with a melodic touch—created a unique dynamic. Although Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence is often cited as a milestone post-hardcore album, it saw little push from Roadrunner, causing the band to garner an ill-will towards the label. Matters were somewhat worsened when Palumbo started to have bouts with his Crohn's disease on tour, as his aggressive performance style sometimes triggers a relapse, which has the potential to be fatal. It is alleged that Roadrunner would not allow Palumbo to leave the tour to rest.\n",
            "Larry Gorman of Orange 9mm officially took over drumming duties part-way through touring, which saw dates with Deftones and a six-week European tour with Soulfly.[8] The line-up continued to rotate following the conclusion of the tour when Manuel Carrero was kicked out by Roadrunner for being the only member to have date conflicts with touring.\n",
            "The album was pressed onto vinyl in 2009, limited to 10,000 copies.[9]\n"

            "The band took a hiatus in 2004, while Palumbo was composing and performing with his new group Head Automatica—which included drummer Larry Gorman—and Beck worked on his band merchandise business. In late 2004, Todd Weinstock, Dave Allen, and Larry Gorman were all fired from the band, fueling rumors that they had split up.[14] Indeed, the band's website displayed \"RIP GlassJAw\" in the header for a time, though this may have been in jest.[14] The band denied that they were splitting up and cited Palumbo's ongoing problems with Crohn's disease as one of the reasons for the hiatus.[15]\n",
            "After a two-year hiatus, the band played three shows in 2005; two at The Downtown in Farmingdale, New York, with proceeds going to charity, and a spot on The Used's tour at the Hammerstein Ballroom. They were initially meant to be main tour support for The Used, but Palumbo had further problems with his Crohn's (Head Automatica also cancelled all their US shows).[16] Manuel Carrero, who had been playing with a band named The Jiant, replaced Allen as bassist after nearly five years away from the group. Durijah Lang, who was also a former band member from their early years, replaced Larry Gorman behind the kit. The band did not fill its vacant guitarist role and continued as a four-piece.\n",
            "In October 2005 the band released a B-side EP of songs not used on Worship and Tribute, titled El Mark. Their official website became active once again in November 2006. The band would go on to tour in December of that year as support for Deftones,[17] and a few headlining shows of their own (dubbed the Fucking Tour 2006[18]). Palumbo said, 'The best thing about the tour was just having it happen'.[19] Also, on New Year's Eve of 2006, they played at two-day festival Stillborn Fest in Connecticut, alongside Hatebreed and others.[20] Along with new material was the confirmation that a new album would be released in 2007, with the new songs introduced at the shows included.\n",
            "Glassjaw's official site homepage showed \"7.7.7.\" in large bold text, referring to a one-off show at the Carling Academy Brixton in England. It was then announced on fan site Glassjaw.net that they would be playing a warm up show at the Camden Barfly on 6.7.7. These shows were the first in the UK for four years. At the end of 2007, Glassjaw, for the first time, headlined in southern California in various venues such as the Avalon in Hollywood, the House of Blues in San Diego, and the Glasshouse in Pomona.[21] This was dubbed the \"100% Maybe\" tour, a joke referring to the uncertain nature of their tours due to frequent cancellations. The band was one of the headlining acts of 2007's Saints & Sinners Festival at the Asbury Park Convention Hall in Asbury Park, New Jersey, along with Against Me!.\n",
            "In 2008, Glassjaw returned to the UK, playing at the two-day festival Give It A Name in Sheffield on May 10, and in London on May 11. They also did shows in Cardiff, Wales, and Dublin, Ireland.\n"

I just ran out of good reasons not to call it a day.\" The two went on to join Burn.\n",

            "Glassjaw's first performance with the newly installed rhythm section was a surprise performance in Amityville, NY on August 7, 2015.[45] Along with that performance, the band played a handful of performances including Wrecking Ball Festival, Heavy Montreal, Taste Of Chaos Festival, and Aftershock Festival, as well as a show opening for Coheed And Cambria in Asbury Park, New Jersey, and a headling show in San Francisco with Dance Gavin Dance.\n",
            "On December 1, 2015, Glassjaw released a new song titled \"New White Extremity\" on the band's Soundcloud account. Music news website Pitchfork stated that the band would be releasing a new album, but did not give detail on when the album would be released.[46] While it is currently unknown who performed drums and bass guitar on the album, The Dillinger Escape Plan drummer Billy Rymer announced on his Instagram account the day of the song's release that he was the one that performed drums on the track. However, his comment on the song was deleted for unknown reasons.\n",

At this warm up show, they performed \"New White Extremity\" as well as six other new songs, which they did not name at the time. The following night, February 1, 2016 Glassjaw played at the O2 Ritz in Manchester Theater, again playing more new material including another song called \"Shira\".\n",

At these headlining shows, the band's setlist contained mostly new songs that have yet to be released. Some of these news songs are speculated to be titled \"Neo\", \"Metal\", \"Post Apocalyptic\", and \"Abigados\".[47] The band did not make any other announcements about their oft-rumored third album for nearly two years.

            "Glassjaw's next release was highly anticipated, not only due to their last full-length release dating back to 2002, but also the delay and lack of information regarding its status and/or release. In an interview with Palumbo in the July 2006 issue of AP magazine, he stated that the band were in the process of writing and recording new material for the next album, which they hoped to release in 2007. Palumbo hinted that there could be a unifying concept behind the album.\nIn November 2007, in the first Glassjaw interview in years, Beck revealed they had written \"about eleven good songs -- seven [that] I love, and four to six half-baked ideas we need to finish\".[2] In an interview with Kerrang!, Palumbo stated that the new album should be released by \"The end of this year or early 2009...I hope.\" Details emerged from The Grixer in May 2008 that the album was \"awaiting vocals\" and \"should be wrapped up and completed in the coming months\".[22] In a May 2008 interview with Verse One magazine, Beck said: \"Right now I’d just be happy to finish up this record. I’m sure if it’s not a giant pile of shit, we’d love to play it live. Exact dates, plans, don't know yet.\"[23] In a June 2008 interview conducted by Glassjaw.net, Beck stated, \"As far as I am personally concerned, there will be a release well before the end of the year.\"[24]\n",
            "The album was not produced by Ross Robinson, as with previous releases; instead Beck co-produced the album with his friend Jonathan Florencio. Florencio also engineered the album.[2][23][24] By June 2008, drums, bass, and guitar parts of thirteen songs had been tracked,[24] however vocal tracking was incomplete, with some vocals having been recorded for \"You Think You're (John Fucking Lennon)\", \"Jesus Glue\", the reworked \"Star Above My Bed\" (based on the Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and not Don Fury version), and \"Natural Born Farmer,\"[25] all of which had been played live and which were expected to be included on the album;[26]  however, tracks \"Convectuoso\" and \"Midwestern Stylings\" were not included on Worship and Tribute, despite media reports and announcements at live shows.[8] A fifth, unnamed track had only freestyle vocals recorded,[25] perhaps indicating that lyrics were yet to be written for the rest of the album at this point. It was rumored prior to the official announcement that the album would be self-titled, and Beck hinted, though speculatively, at a possible digital release.[24] He also stated he would have wanted to release the record himself, but it is likely it will be released by Warner Bros., as with Worship and Tribute.[25]\n",
            "On October 14, 2008 bassist Manuel Carrero wrote on the Glassjaw.net forum: \"I feel like a kid that's been asked to clean his room, but the room still isn't clean, and every time the kid peeks out of the room, he is immediately asked if it's finished. (And I've already cleaned my section of the room.) I wish I had an answer for everyone, but I am pretty much in the dark. I mean, let’s be frank, here. I just play the bass. I have no delusions about my role. I have no control of what happens with the band. I would love to tell you that the record is done. I would love to tell you when or if we are going to tour again. The sad truth is, I just don’t know. I don’t know if anyone knows.\"[27][28]\n",
            "On October 23, 2008 Tommy Corrigan of Silent Majority revealed he had heard recorded songs from the album, and that \"it had a latin/spanish music feel to some songs [...] they were [...] HEAVILY groove/feel oriented.\"[29][30] This has been affirmed in an October 29, 2008 interview with Beck, which also states the album has a split style, with the five songs featuring vocals sounding much unlike the rest of the album (indeed, four of these songs were played live as early as 2003, and possibly written in the previous year).[25]\n",
            "On November 22, 2008 the band posted the drum intro to \"(You Think You're) John Fucking Lennon\" on their MySpace page, naming it 'It's A Fucking Intro You Asshole' for the album 'Don't Ask Me' with release date '2022.'[31][32] On November 28, 2008 the band posted the full studio-recorded version of \"(You Think You're) John Fucking Lennon\" on their website as a hidden stream.[33][34] They removed all usual site material and links, replacing it with a Glassjaw flag backdrop (a green variant of the Puerto Rican flag), which linked to the band's official clothing line.\n",

I said that only four songs, (ones that we have been playing live with this lineup), have vocals, but that's old news, anyway. I can't really discuss any more than that. I probably shouldn't have even discussed that.\"\nManny has recently[when?] been playing shows with influential New Jersey post-hardcore band Thursday. Although consensus is that Manny is simply filling in for Thursday's bassist and has no plans to join the band or leave Glassjaw, this has still sparked considerable discussion amongst fans.\n",

Shit SLAMS.\" It was initially unclear whether the EP was meant to be a promo for a full-length album, or if it would be the final Glassjaw release. It was later confirmed by Daryl himself that the EP is a promo for a full-length album via Twitter on June 23, in which a fan asked \"Just read your interview.  Are you saying there's gonna be a Glassjaw Album to follow the EP???\" to which Daryl replied, \"of course.\"\n",
            "On July 20 2009, Palumbo confirmed through Revolt that there would be a new Glassjaw EP and LP to be released in the coming months.  He was quoted as saying \"It's a five- or six-song EP, and the EP will be slightly different from the full-length. The new Glassjaw stuff is far more aggressive than it was previously. This is stuff that Justin (Beck) and I have been working on for a long time. It's far more aggressive than I ever thought it would be.\"[35]\n",
            "In the fall of 2009, Glassjaw supported Brand New on their headline tour.[36] Not long after, Palumbo, Beck and Manny conducted an exclusive video interview for Glassjaw.net on Ryan's Rock Show, where the band stated that the long absence of released material was due to \"decisions we made when we were 21 years old,\" alluding to a possible legal/contractual dispute with either Roadrunner or most likely with their second major label, Warner Bros.[37]\n",

The song's title was announced by Daryl Palumbo via Twitter some months before.  It was the first new song that Glassjaw has played in nearly four years (\"Lennon\" and \"Jesus Glue\" were debuted late 2006). In addition, the band also added \"El Mark\" and \"Convectuoso\" to their setlists, two fan-favorite B-sides that had been sparingly played live. On the last show of their 2010 tour at Emo's in Austin, TX, the band premiered a new song with the tentative title \"Wolfegg\". \n",

Other fans received a random postcard in the mail. The postcard had no return label, no explanation and consisted of a perforated logo.

            "In 2001, the band entered the studio in secret with Ross Robinson and began recording their follow-up album Worship and Tribute, which would see release the following year. The album was engineered and mixed by Mike Fraser. They left Roadrunner, finding them problematic, and shopped the album to other labels and ended up signing a deal with Warner Bros. Records. The line-up on this record was Palumbo, Beck (who also provided bass duties), Weinstock, and Shannon Larkin of Amen and later Godsmack, who provided drumming duties due to recording time constraints, as he had worked well with producer Ross Robinson in the past, although Larry Gorman was composing parts and officially the drummer of the band. Ross Robinson does not use a 'click track' (automated metronome) when recording drummers, as he believes \"it takes away from the true essence of the music\". This album showcased a more melodic and mature Glassjaw, as they started to further incorporate jazz and ambient influences, particularly in tracks like \"Ape Dos Mil\", \"Must've Run All Day\", \"The Gillette Cavalcade of Sports\", and \"Convectuoso\" (which did not appear on the official release due to a publishing dispute with Roadrunner). Palumbo said of it: \"It's a mélange of influences, a collage is what this band is all about. This record pays tribute to everything from Bad Brains to Anthrax to The Cure to Squeeze and so much more.\"[6] Lyrically, the more confrontational elements heard on 'Everything...' were reined in, with Palumbo taking a more cerebral approach.\n",
            "Dave Allen joined the group as bassist following the recording of the album. The band then toured extensively throughout 2002-2003, playing all over the world, including festival tours such as Warped Tour, Ozzfest and Snocore. In October 2002, dates in Germany and the UK were cancelled when Palumbo was hospitalized in Paris after suffering a relapse of the Crohn's; he underwent intestinal surgery.[10][11] The dates were rescheduled to December, but he suffered another relapse. On their return in April 2003 he was hospitalized again in Glasgow, Scotland, which led to cancellations including the Kerrang! Weekender and a date at the London Astoria.[12][13]\n"

         "Glassjaw have been regarded as one of the most influential bands of the post-hardcore genre. Born of the Long Island hardcore scene, producer Ross Robinson declared in 2000 that Glassjaw \"was on a mission to destroy the ‘Adidas Rock’ of nu-metal bands like Limp Bizkit.\"[72] Their usage of dissonant melodies through their two guitarists, Justin Beck and Todd Weinstock, created a jazz-like sound that was unique and original for the genre.[72] Nick Greer of Sputnikmusic stated that \"part of what makes Glassjaw such a stand out band is a combination of structured genre blending and blissfully naive experimentation.\"[73] Michael Ventimiglia of the Long Island Press said that their Worship and Tribute album \"helped shape and define music for a new generation.\"[74]\n",
         "Modern post-hardcore bands such as Funeral for a Friend, Night Verses, The Movielife and Letlive have named Glassjaw as a formidable influence.[75][76][77] Funeral For a Friend lead singer Matt Davies-Kreye stated that \"Glassjaw are such an experimental band and integrate a lot of different styles and influences in their music such as ambient rock, hardcore, post-rock and jazz. They always taught me to go against the grain, pay more attention to dynamics and think outside of the box when writing songs. I like to think that our new material is heavily GlassJaw-influenced.\"[75] Mike Cunniff of Boston Manor said that \"they definitely have a strong cult following not dissimilar to Brand New. Their music has stood the test of time because they have always been so fresh and original.”[75]\n"

   "Musical style": {
      "text": [
         "The band's sound has always been rooted in the New York hardcore scene.[59] Elements of the late 1980s youth crew style of hardcore are prominent in their earlier recordings, and Youth of Today have been cited as an important influence.[4] Beck has cited Faith No More's attitude towards making music as an influence,[4] while Palumbo has specifically cited Mike Patton as a huge influence on him.[60] Glassjaw has been described as nu metal early on in their career,[61][62][63][64] alternative metal[65][66] and post-hardcore.[67]\n",
         "Apart from this, Palumbo's lyrics are known to frequently quote other artists as a tribute, quoting acts such as Frank Zappa, Tori Amos, Gravediggaz, among others.\n",
         "RockSound named the band \"The Biggest DIY Band In The World\" because of the band's independence from major labels, insistence on maintaining creative control of both their sound and presentation and grass roots approach to distributing their music despite several hiatuses. On why the band still exists, Palumbo stated, \"Glassjaw provides a real outlet for all our creativity. And allows us to sit around making dick and fart jokes all day.\" Beck stated, \"Glassjaw would suck if this was how we paid our rent because then you'd make stupid decisions in order to pay the bills. Once money and popularity have a bearing on your art then it's gone, diluted. You lose it.\"[68]\n",
         "In a nod to how the band shuns the music industry standard of putting out an album, when asked why the long wait for new music, Palumbo stated \"...we write a lot. When the band is at the forefront, that’s when the spark really seems to happen. If it was up to me and him, we’d get together every weekend and make an album almost every few months. But I think the most poignant and potent Glassjaw [comes from] us stockpiling the goodness until it’s time to do it. And when it’s time to do it, the universe very much lets us know.”[69]\n"

   "Problems with Roadrunner Records": {
      "text": [
         "Both Palumbo and Beck continue to speak unfavourably of Roadrunner, years after the problems the band experienced with them. They openly advise people not to buy their first full-length so as not to give the label money, and have repeatedly told fans at shows to illegally download the record.[24] Palumbo has said of them: \"Roadrunner is a joke. Roadrunner’s not even a real label. It has the power to be one of the superpowers in the heavy music industry. While labels like Victory Records, which is such a small hardcore label, is totally surpassing Roadrunner. Roadrunner is a joke. It's like the scourge of the music industry.\"[60] Beck has said: \"Seriously, don't ever support anything from Roadrunner -- they suck!\"[70] Palumbo has said that Roadrunner didn't put the band on enough tours: \"We never toured half as much as we wanted to, I just wish we got to tour more in support of [Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence]\"; and \"We were on Roadrunner for a couple of years and Roadrunner was a joke, a fuckin' joke of a label. They are a miserable fuckin' corporation that does not bend for their bands, does not give their bands anything and they're just terrible businessmen. They are a giant joke of a label. They had 2 cash cows, Slipknot and Nickelback, and every other project they had rode backseat to those bands, and then the second that the new Slipknot record came out and didn't go quadruple Platinum in the first few hours it was released they fuckin' turned their backs on Slipknot. That label just wants instant gratification where it sells its units and that's a joke. You can't run a major corporation with that as your business strategy\".[7]\n",
         "Regarding the re-release of the remastered version of Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence on March 2009 by Roadrunner, Beck was quoted by Alter The Press! in saying \"It's complete shit!  We had nothing to do with it.  DO NOT BUY IT!  It's embarrassing.\"[71]\n"
