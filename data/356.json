         "The band was formed in Vancouver by producers John Dexter and John Livingston, and consisted of three teenaged girls, Camille Henderson, Aimee MacKenzie and Silvana Petrozzi. After several months of performing lessons with Henderson's father Bill Henderson, the lead singer of rock group Chilliwack, the trio recorded and released their debut album, West End Girls, on Johnny Jet Records in 1991. That album produced the Canadian Top 10 hits \"Not Like Kissing You\" and \"I Want U Back\" (a remake of the Jackson 5 hit), as well as the Top 40 singles \"Say You'll Be Mine\" and \"Show Me The Way\".\n",
         "Petrozzi left the band in 1992, and was replaced by Janele Woodley. In 1993, shortly before the release of the group's second album, Henderson also left and was replaced by Celia-Louise Martin. In 1993, the band's new lineup released the album We Belong Together, which included the singles  \"R U Sexin' Me\", \"Pure\", and \"Sexy'\". Their second album wasn't as successful as their first one and they broke up the following year. Shortly afterwards, the group's record label released a remix album of some of their earlier hits.\n",
         "They received a Juno Award nomination for Most Promising New Group in 1992 and they also toured with Roxette on the Canadian leg of that group's 1992 Canadian tour.\n",
         "MacKenzie later joined the Canadian R & B group D-Cru, and their single \"Show Me\" sampled the West End Girls single \"Show Me The Way\".  She is now a swimsuit model.\n",
         "Petrozzi/Kane later formed Pacifika with guitarist Adam Popowitz, bassist Toby Peter, and percussionist Elliot Polsky.  Their first album, Asunci√≥n, was released in 2007 and their second, Super Magique, was released in 2010.  Kane released a solo album, La Jardinera, in November 2012.\n",
         "Henderson later toured extensively as a backing vocalist for Sarah McLachlan and performed lead vocals on Delerium's track \"Duende\".  She is now a vocal coach.\n",
         "Woodley later formed the pop rock duo A Perfect Day with Joseph Hrechka and they released the album All Over Everything in 2004.\n",
         "Martin has done occasional acting gigs.\n"
