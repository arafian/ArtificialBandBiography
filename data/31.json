      "Sweet Water is an American rock band from Seattle, Washington.\n",
      "\nOriginally known as S.G.M., the majority of Sweet Water's members met while students at The Bush School. SGM had garnered acclaim as second generation punk pioneers in the Seattle scene, playing with Nirvana, the Accused, The Rejectors, The Melvins and more. Bruce Pavitt called the original SGM demo \"Young, loud and crazy. Better than Soundgarden and Green River put together. Better than Led Zep and the Stooges even\"  ",
      "SGM evolved into Sweet Water as the band lineup changed in 1990. The original Sweet Water included Adam Czeisler, vocals, Rich Credo, rhythm guitar, Cole Peterson, bass guitar, Dudley Taft, lead guitar and Paul Uhlir, Drums. Garnering acclaim for their debut on New Rage Records, Sweet Water, the band was subsequently signed in 1992 by Jason Flom of Atlantic Records and released its second self-titled album, Sweet Water produced by Don Gilmore (Linkin Park, Dashboard Confessional, Lit, Pearl Jam) and mixed by Tim Palmer (Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam, Tin Machine, Robert Plant).   The band were then signed to Elektra Records subsidiary East-West, and they recorded a follow-up record Superfriends with Dave Jerden (Alice in Chains, Jane's Addiction) producing. Guitarist Taft was fired during the recording of Superfriends and a new Sweet Water sound took shape with Rich Credo as sole guitarist. Producer Dave Jerden called the band \"Mott the Hoople meets the 90's\"  Superfriends had two charting singles, \"Feed Yourself\" and \"Superstar\" with the track \"Superstar\" reaching #40 on the modern rock charts.   \n"
