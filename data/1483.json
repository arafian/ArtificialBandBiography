         "The Blackouts were a punk rock band formed in Seattle in 1979 by singer/guitarist Erich Werner, bassist Mike Davidson, and drummer Bill Rieflin, who were all former members of a local punk band, The Telepaths.[3] They were joined by Roland Barker, first on synthesizer and later on saxophone.[3][4]\n",
         "Following a single and EP on small local labels, Davidson was replaced by Roland's brother Paul Barker in 1981.[5]  This line-up recorded the \"Exchange of Goods\" single for English label Situation Two, and relocated to Boston in 1982.[1] There they met Al Jourgensen of Ministry, who produced their last recording, the Lost Soul's Club EP for Wax Trax! Records.[6]\n",
         "The band relocated a second time to San Francisco in 1984, and toured the East Coast with Ministry that year before breaking up.[6]  Jourgensen recruited Paul and Roland Barker and Rieflin to the line-up of Ministry, playing a major part in the transformation of Ministry from a synth-driven dance band to one of the top exponents of industrial metal.[1] This started a long collaboration between Paul Barker and Jourgensen in Ministry, Revolting Cocks, Lard, and other projects. Rieflin released his first solo album in 1999, Birth of a Giant,[5] worked with KMFDM, Pigface, Ruby, Peter Murphy, Nine Inch Nails,[5] Swans, and King Crimson, and was the studio and touring drummer for R.E.M..[7] Erich Werner went on to join the Toiling Midgets.[8]\n",
         "In 2004, Olympia's K Records released History in Reverse, compiling the band's studio recordings.[8]\n"
