         "Honey was a Christian, ambient rock band composed of Doug Moss, Paul Lagestee, Billy Wan, and Roger Moss.  The band recorded three albums between 1997 and 2001.[1]  The first two, Lovely and Lost on You, were released on the now-defunct Sub•Lime Records.  Their third album, aptly titled Three, was released by Northern Records.  The first effort was produced by Christian alt/rock legend Steve Hindalong and was characterised by a rough, guitar-driven sound.  For their second effort, production credits were diverse but significant with Jars of Clay's Dan Haseltine and Stephen Mason lending a hand as well as The Prayer Chain alumni Eric Campuzano and Wayne Everett.  The result was a more approachable sound that was at once extraordinarily mellow and enormously engaging.  As a departure from their first album, the work could be described as a \"concept worship album\".[2]  Indeed, many songs read as abstract praises of God.  With their third album, Honey made a strong musical departure, moving to an up-tempo, alt/pop flavour.  Thematically, the focus moved from theology to what could be described as \"a soundtrack to a wistful, longing, romantic love life\".[3]  They disbanded soon after the release of Three.\n"
