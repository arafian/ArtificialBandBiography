      "Omen is an American heavy metal band.\n",
      "The band was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1983 by lead guitarist Kenny Powell, previously with the band Savage Grace, and signed on with Metal Blade in 1984, with whom they released their debut, Battle Cry. (It contained the song \"The Axeman\", which appeared on the soundtrack for the heavy metal themed 2009 video game Brütal Legend.)\n",
      "In 1985, the second album Warning of Danger followed, which could easily compare with their debut, and built up Omen's reputation as one of the forefathers of power metal acts. In 1986, they released The Curse, their first release with major label distribution by Capitol Records in the US. In Japan the band climbed to number 14 in the Burrn! Charts.\n"
