         "The band was formed in 1977 by Paul Burgess and Tom Coulter at the Boys Model School in Belfast, Coulter originally acting as vocalist but sticking to bass when Ivan Kelly joined.[1] Kelly left in 1979 to join London band The Wall, and was replaced by Allan Clarke.[1] By the time of their first release, \"One By One\" on Terri Hooley's Good Vibrations label, they had also been joined by guitarist Jackie Forgie.[2][3] They had two hits on the UK Independent Chart, \"Capital Letters\", which reached number 31, and \"Wild Colonial Boy\" which reached number 46.[3]\n",
         "They released their debut album, Flowers for all Occasions, on Kasper Records in 1985.[4] It received a five-star review from Sounds, with Roger Holland describing it as a \"positively heroic album\".[4]\n",
         "They were notable for their anti-sectarian stance at a time when the Troubles were at their height in Northern Ireland. A later line-up of the band featured Gordy Blair who also performed with Highway Star, the band that was to become Stiff Little Fingers.[1] In 1976 he joined Belfast punk band Rudi. Forgie joined Colenso Parade and later formed the Black Taxi Ballads.[1][5]\n"
