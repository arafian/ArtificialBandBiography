         "With their second album the band took a giant step by adding more of a rock edge to many of the songs while staying true to their country roots.[5] It was recorded at Mama Jo's in North Hollywood and produced by Al Perkins. It was recorded in the nighttime and early-morning hours, because of Ambrosia's daytime sessions.[2][6]\n",
         "In 1974 they also recorded a song for the Maranatha! 4 compilation entitled \"Have You Ever Heard\".[2][7] In 1979, the song \"He's the Reason to Go On\", off their debut album, was used by the label on Best of Maranatha, Volume 1.[2][8]\n"
