      "text": [
         "Blue Monday was formed by guitarist Kyle De Ville and vocalist Dave Mac in the spring of 2001. After securing a drummer and bassist the band proceeded to write an eight-song demo which came out in early 2002.[2] After a few short tours down the west coast Blue Monday entered the studio again in mid-2002 and recorded the War Wounds 7\" EP which came out in early 2003 on the now defunct For The Core Records from California.\n",
         "In early 2003, the original bassist and drummer left the band.  With these departures Adam Mitchell and Jason Kehoe joined on bass and drums respectively. Adam's brother Dave joined at the end of 2003.  In 2003, Blue Monday released their second EP, What's Done Is Done on Stab And Kill Records from Boston, Massachusetts. Blue Monday spent the bulk of 2003 and 2004 touring throughout the US. They toured with fellow hardcore bands such as Mental, Desperate Measures, Far From Breaking, Lights Out, Final Word, Internal Affairs, The Distance, and Allegiance during this time.\n",
         "What's Done Is Done and the subsequent touring brought Blue Monday to the attention of seminal modern hardcore label Bridge Nine Records who signed them after playing the now defunct Summer Hardcore Festival Posi-Numbers in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  In December, Blue Monday entered Atomic Studios in Brooklyn, New York and recorded their debut album for Bridge Nine engineered Dean Baltulonis. With the release of Rewritten in the spring of 2005 Blue Monday toured with label mates Champion, Terror and completed a full US tour with fellow Vancouver band Go It Alone and Allegiance from the bay area.  In October 2005, Blue Monday co-headlined a tour in Europe with friends Go It Alone.\n"
