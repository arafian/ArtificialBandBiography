      "Long-time keyboardist Candice Jones (Bebe Coathanger), left the band amicably in 2013. \"This happened about three years ago, and it wasn't on bad terms,\" explains Stephanie Luke of the exit. \"Candice just wanted to go on to pursue college and other things. We still are friends to this day and we just found out she is engaged so we are very happy for her!\"\n",
      "The name \"Coathangers\" refers to a method of self-induced abortion and was chosen for its irreverent vulgarity; all of the band's members are pro-choice.\n"
