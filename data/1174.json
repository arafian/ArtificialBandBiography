         "Evolove is an American alternative rock band. The band’s members are Lucy Levinsohn (lead vocals), Dave Corsile (guitar), Billy Berman (Bass), and Colby Jensen (rhythm guitar). The band’s name is a palindrome (the word ‘love’ spelled backwards then forwards).\n",
         "Evolove was thrust in the public spotlight as finalists of the Freecreditscore.com national band search [1]. Their national commercial made its debut during the MLB All-Star game, viewed by 12 million and has subsequently been aired on national networks. Evolove also made several television appearances (to include MTV and KTLA News) related to their success with their commercial.\n",
         "Evolove's debut EP, 2012: Countdown to the End, was released in October 2009. The EP was produced by Jarrett Zellea, and mixed by Brian Virtue (Audioslave, 30 Seconds to Mars, Deftones) and gained critical acclaim with HollywoodMusicMagazine.com lauding, \"Pop inspired guitar riffs and personal yet direct lyrics are what make this album a gem.\" [2] Shortly after the release of the EP, the band signed a music licensing agreement with MTV  and was heard on the MTV shows Made, True Life and Teen Mom. In the summer of 2010, the band placed three songs off the EP on ABC's top-rated teen drama Pretty Little Liars.\n",
         "This placement introduced them to audiences internationally with digital downloads on sites such as Cdbaby and iTunes (USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, Europe). As a featured artist on Hot Topic’s “Shop ‘til you Drop” tour resulted in a distribution deal. The band was signed to Planet LA records [3] in 2009 and went on the “Abolitionist Tour” with that label to SXSW but declined to continue that relationship when their contract expired in 2011.\n"
