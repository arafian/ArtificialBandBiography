The group appeared on the Christian television show The Logan Show on December 9, 2006. The band ended in 2011 after releasing a three song EP of covers which was recorded before their lead singer left in 2009.\n",
      "This Beautiful Republic started out of Toledo, Ohio in 2004. Olin joined the other members of the group after they lost their lead singer. All of the members in the newly formed group besides the new drummer, Cameron Toews from California, went to high school together at Toledo Christian Schools. When asked about the origin of the band's name, Olin replied \"We wanted something that’s catchy, but that’s something that’s really inclusive. It represents the kingdom of heaven on earth. We get a glimpse when we interact with each other as Christians, and push each other. We hope it’s like the kingdom, pre-heaven.\"\n",
      "The group was signed to ForeFront Records in November 2006. They released their Casting Off EP on January 7, 2007. Shortly after, on April 3 they released their full-length debut album, Even Heroes Need a Parachute, from which they released their first single \"Casting Off\".\n"
