      "Great White is an American rock band, formed in Los Angeles in 1977. They gained their name from the shark of the same name the great white shark. They got their popularity during the 1980s and early 1990s. The band released several albums in the late 1980s and gained airplay on MTV with music videos for songs like \"Once Bitten, Twice Shy\". The band reached their peak popularity with the album ...Twice Shy in 1989. The band continued to release new material into the 1990s, although none of their material charted in the United States. \n",
      "The band broke up in 2001. Soon thereafter, lead singer Jack Russell started to tour with Tony Montana, Robby Lochner (Halford), Dan McNay (Montrose) and Dicki Fliszar (Skin (British band)/ (Bruce Dickinson) as \"Jack Russell's Great White\", a group which doesn't include the band's co-founding guitarist Mark Kendall. Great White made headlines when, in 2003, a Rhode Island nightclub at which they were playing caught fire due to their negligence, leading to the deaths of 100 people, including band member Ty Longley. Great White reformed in 2006. In 2011, Russell left the band, starting to tour again as \"Jack Russell's Great White\".\n",
      "As of August 2008, Great White estimated they had sold around eight million records worldwide.\n"
