         "XXI (formerly, A Feast for Kings (AFFK)) is an American Christian rock band that also takes influences from Alternative metal and Post-hardcore. They come from Carrollton, Kentucky, where they were formed in 2010, with lead vocalist Eric Gentry. Eric's death in 2014 was the reasoning behind the band's name change, with 'XXI' (Roman numerals for '21') being Eric's age at the time of his death. Their first extended play, Hell on Earth, was released in 2014, shortly before Eric's death, and under their former name. The debut studio album, Inside Out, was released with Carson Butcher as lead vocalist on Tooth & Nail Records in 2015. This album was their breakthrough album on both the Billboard magazine Christian Albums and Heatseekers Albums charts.\n"
