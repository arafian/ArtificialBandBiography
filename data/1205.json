      "Honk is an American rock band, based in Laguna Beach, California. It's best known for providing the soundtrack for the surf documentary film, Five Summer Stories.\n",
      "The band was formalized in 1970, recorded some demo songs, and then recorded their first album for a $1500 fee. It was the soundtrack for the \"cinematic cult classic\" surf film, Five Summer Stories. In the early 1970s they toured with The Beach Boys, Chicago, Jackson Browne and Dave Mason before splitting up in 1975. The band reformed in 1985 and continue to occasionally perform.\n",
      "\"Honk had a reputation for being a musician's kind of band,\" Stekol said. \"It was a lot of fun. Honk's problem was with the business, not the players. No one had any difficulty with anyone else in the band. But no one had the ego to stay with it when things weren't working.\""
