      "Keel is an American heavy metal band founded in 1984 in Los Angeles, California. They are known for their rock anthem \"The Right to Rock.\" The band was active until 1989, with a brief reunion in 1998. Keel reunited again in 2008 and toured in 2009 for their 25th anniversary. Although the band is still active to this day, they have not released any new material since 2010.\n",
      "Keel was formed by former Steeler vocalist Ron Keel. The original members were Ron Keel on vocals, former Icon / Schoolboys member David Michael Phillips on guitar, Marc Ferrari on lead & rhythm guitars, Bobby Marks on drums and Kenny Chaisson on bass guitar. Within months, Phillips left to join King Kobra and was replaced by ex-Cheetah guitarist Bryan Jay. This was the lineup for their 1984 debut album Lay Down the Law. After the album's release, Marks left and was replaced by Steven Riley, who subsequently left early in the recording of the band's second album to join W.A.S.P., and was in turn replaced by Dwain Miller, forming a lineup which would remain stable for almost four years. Their debut album caught the eye of KISS' Gene Simmons, resulting in his production of their second album, The Right To Rock, released on March 26, 1985. Their next and also Simmons-produced third album The Final Frontier was released on April 30, 1986. It included the single \"Because the Night\", a song that was co-written by Patti Smith and Bruce Springsteen and had been a hit for Smith in 1978.\n",
      "In 1986, Keel won the Best Band of the Year award in the second annual Metal Edge magazine reader's poll, beating such noted bands as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest.\n"
