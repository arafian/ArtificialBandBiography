      "The Prettiots is an American all-female alternative band from Brooklyn, New York. It consists of Kay Kasperhauser and Lulu Landolfi. Rachel Trachtenburg was the band's drummer briefly. After performing five shows at SXSW in 2015, the band was praised by NPR music critics Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton and was signed to Rough Trade Records.\n",
      "Their first full-length album, Funs Cool, was released in 2016 and earned positive reviews from critics, who praised the blunt honesty of their lyrics, the prominent use of the ukulele in their music, and their inventive reinterpretations of other songs (The Misfits, Dolly Parton). Several reviewers noted that The Prettiots subvert the \"cutesy\" tropes and expectations that come along with being an independent band fronted by women and featuring ukulele.\n",
      "The single, Suicide Hotline, has been especially praised for its sardonic humor and honest discussion of mental health. Katie Presley of NPR wrote that the song \"couches stunning barbs of insight between sweet, fun harmonies and playful ukulele strums.\"\n"
