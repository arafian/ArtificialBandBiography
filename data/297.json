The band consists of Daniel McBurnie (vocals, acoustic guitar), Graham Gomez (electric guitar, vocals), Alexa Unwin (piano, vocals), Robert Hardie (bass, vocals), Alex Hauka (cello), Gregory McLeod (trombone and violin) and Will Watson (drums).\n",
      "Their first self-titled EP, Good for Grapes was released on iTunes Canada on April 15, 2011. They have won both the Rogers urMusic Battle of the Bands, and Supernova's 'Band on the Run to the UK.'\n",
      "The band was formed when a group of friends were traveling by ferry to busk in Victoria, British Columbia, on Vancouver Island. They drew crowds while freestyling on the ferry deck and decided that they should pursue the project. Months later they had produced their first EP and started playing small, local gigs. They officially began their career playing in coffee shops, such as The Wired Monk, charity shows, small venues, and eventually began by opening up for bands such as Paper Lions, The Matinee and Mother Mother. They have also gone on to record in Toronto's Coalition Studios and Vancouver's Greenhouse Studios.\n"
