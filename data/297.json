      "The band was formed when a group of friends were traveling by ferry to busk in Victoria, British Columbia, on Vancouver Island. They drew crowds while freestyling on the ferry deck and decided that they should pursue the project. Months later they had produced their first EP and started playing small, local gigs. They officially began their career playing in coffee shops, such as The Wired Monk, charity shows, small venues, and eventually began by opening up for bands such as Paper Lions, The Matinee and Mother Mother. They have also gone on to record in Toronto's Coalition Studios and Vancouver's Greenhouse Studios.\n"
