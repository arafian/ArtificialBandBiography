      "Prior to forming Distant Cousins, Dov Rosenblatt was the lead singer of the Jewish rock band Blue Fringe, while Duvid Swirsky was a founding member of the band Moshav. Swirsky, Rosenblatt, and Kozak met in Los Angeles in 2012 while their respective bands were playing a show together. Upon hearing a song Swirsky and Rosenblatt had written, \"When We Love\", Kozak offered to produce it, and the three subsequently began playing together. The name Distant Cousins, a reference to the members' longtime familiarity with each other, was first used when writing a song for the 2013 film Coffee Town.\n",
