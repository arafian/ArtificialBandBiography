         "Kruzenshtern & Parohod (Russian: Крузенштерн и Пароход) is a Russophone Israel klezmer-rock band from Tel Aviv, created in 2002. Its style is variously branded as \"experimental jazz\", \"klezmercore\" (a pun on \"hardcore\"), \"ethno jazz\", \"avant-garde\".\n",
         "The core team is : \n",
         "They often play with various guests.\n",
         "The name of the band is a pun immediately recognizable by all post-Soviet Russophones. In Russia (as well as in other Russophone places), a fictional steamship \"Admiral Ivan Fyodorovich Kruzenshtern\" from the popular Prostokvashino animated film series is very well known, often as part of a catch phrase \"Admiral I.F.Kruzenshtern, a man and a steamship\", \"pirated\" from the title of a requiem poem by Vladimir Mayakovsky, To Comrade Nette, a Man and a Steamship. The fictional steamship is named after a Russian admiral and explorer Adam Johann von Krusenstern, as is since 1946 a real sailing ship, the Kruzenshtern. Parohod means \"steamboat\" in Russian.\n"
