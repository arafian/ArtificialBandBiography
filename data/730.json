      "The Shaggs were an American all-female rock and outsider music band formed in Fremont, New Hampshire, in 1968. The band was composed of sisters Dorothy \"Dot\" Wiggin (vocals/lead guitar), Betty Wiggin (vocals/rhythm guitar), Helen Wiggin (drums) and, later, Rachel Wiggin (bass).\n",
      "The Shaggs were formed by Dot, Betty and Helen in 1968, on the insistence of their father, Austin Wiggin, who believed that his mother had predicted the band's rise to stardom. The band's only studio album, Philosophy of the World, was released in 1969. The album failed to garner attention, though the band continued to exist as a locally popular live act. The Shaggs disbanded in 1975 after the death of Austin.\n",
      "The band is primarily notable today for their perceived ineptitude at playing conventional rock music; the band was described in one Rolling Stone article as \"sounding like lobotomized Trapp Family singers.\" Terry Adams of NRBQ compared the group's melodic lines and structures to the free jazz compositions of Ornette Coleman.\n"
