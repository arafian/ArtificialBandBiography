      "text": [
         "Numb was founded by Don Gordon, David Hall and Sean Stubbs in 1986.[2][3] The band issued their self-titled debut studio album Numb in 1987 on Edge and World Records.[4] Their second album Christmeister was released by Lively Art in 1989.[5][6][7]\n",
         "The band's third album Death on the Installment Plan, released in 1993, featured weird electronic tape-loops overlaid with heavily distorted vocals.[8] The 1994 album Wasted Sky used some of the same techniques, but with a darker feel and more technically varied approach.[9][10]\n",
         "Singer David Collins joined the band in 1995; the band released its fifth album, Blood Meridian, which contained strong, violent electronic sound but no guitar music, in 1997.[11][12][13] Two years later, Numb recorded the electronic dance album Language of Silence, released through Metropolis.[14]  The tracks on this album were somewhat quieter and darkly intense.[15][16][17][18][19]\n",
         "Following the release of one final single, \"Suspended\", Numb disbanded in 1998, and Gordon moved to Vietnam to live with his wife.[20]\n",
         "After what was considered by many to be a retirement of the project and Don Gordon from the music scene in general, an album of new material was made available via Bandcamp on August 23, 2019 titled Mortal Geometry.\n"
