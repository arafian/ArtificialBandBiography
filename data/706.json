         "OOIOO is a Japanese experimental rock band. It began as a fictitious band for a photo shoot for a magazine in 1996. The four-piece ensemble was founded by Boredoms drummer and occasional trumpeter and vocalist Yoshimi P-We.[1] When she was asked to do a photo shoot for a magazine she invited a few of her girlfriends to join her and created for the shoot a fake band called OOIOO which they later decided to make real. The band quickly gained attention by being the opening act for Sonic Youth in 1997 on their Japan tour.[2]\n",
         "According to AllMusic's Kieran McCarthy \"It's next to impossible to describe their sound, because — by design — it rarely follows consistent patterns\".[1] Some of their music has been described as having \"a majestic ebb and flow that suggests natural wonders\"[3] or a \"witchy, tribal side\".[3] Either way, at any one time it may incorporate chanting and punchy drums,[3] dancey polyrhythms[4] atonal composition[4] or psychedelia.[5]\n"
