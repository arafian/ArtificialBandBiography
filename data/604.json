         "Kristen Ellis Henderson wrote a memoir about her same-sex marriage Times Two, Two Women in Love and the Happy Family They Made (Simon & Schuster)[2] published on April 5, 2011. The book chronicles the journey she and her wife, Sarah Ellis-Henderson, took to start a family - eventually getting pregnant on exactly the same day and giving birth to their son and daughter. The book's success led to them being tapped by GLAAD as media spokeswomen advocating marriage equality, and the couple were featured on the cover of April 8, 2013 issue of Time Magazine - \"Gay Marriage Already Won.\"\" [3]\n"
