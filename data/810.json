         "Futile Crimes was released November 15, 2002, preceded by the three singles “Sneaky Feelings EP”, “It never entered my mind” and “The Pointer/Make me sad”. The album was released on the newstarted, now legendary Service label and was the beginning of a new popera in Gothenburg. The album consists of 10 songs recorded by Björn Olsson in Sehr Schöön studios and is a blend of disco-pop, twee and pubrock. In combination with the bands anti-rock aesthetics and disrespectful live performances [1] the Embassy became a both loved and questioned band.

         "After a series of singles the band started working on a new album in 2011. The result was a bit more contemplative than we were used to, although with some typical Embassy-sounds.[4] The album never really made it in the charts but was mostly well reviewed,[5] appreciated for its soft groove as in songs like \"Related Artist\" and \"International\". As a final single from the album \"I-D\" was released in november 2013. It came with a beloved suicidal video made by Ty Olson [6] and a b-side with the newly awakened title \"Is This Heaven?\".\n"
