      "The Sweet Lillies are an Americana/bluegrass band from Boulder, Colorado\n",
      "The Sweet Lillies formed in 2013 when classically-trained vocalist Julie Gussaroff met classically-trained violist Becca Bisque at a bluegrass jam in Golden, Colorado. The two wished to start a band that Gussaroff said would be \"a female vocally-led group with high-level instrumentation and original songwriting.\" They added Danjo Lynn Birnberng in 2014 and Melly Frances Sponselee in 2016 to complete the lineup and released their debut, self-titled album in 2016.\n",
      "Birnberg left the band in 2017, and the Sweet Lillies continued on as trio. They recorded their second album, A Lighter Hue, produced by Leftover Salmon's Vince Herman the following year. Following the release of A Lighter Hue, the band added guitarist Dustin Rohleder. Rohleder had first met the Sweet Lillies in 2017 at the Hangtown Festival when they crossed paths at a campground jam. \"The three of us played in the campground for eleven hours straight,\" says Gusssaroff. \"It was incredibly wild.\" Sponselee left the band the following year in 2019.\n"
