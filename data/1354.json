         "Stahlhammer is one of the most popular bands to ever come out of Austria. The band name was originally going to be \"Eisenherz\", but copyright laws for the German \"Prince Valiant\" stories prohibited this, though this later became the name of their fourth album. Their first album Killer Instinkt, released in 1995, became widely known throughout Austria and Germany due to the success of their video for the Pink Floyd cover \"Another Brick In The Wall\". Among Stahlhammer's several covers is a metal styled version of M.C. Hammer's famous hit U Can't Touch This.\n"
