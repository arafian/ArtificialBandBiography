      "Nelken, who works as a cremationist, had a longtime side career as a musician, supporting a number of artists  including A. C. Newman, New Pornographers and Sparrow. He put together a backup band, The Awkward Stage, which included drummer Kurt Dahl, and released a debut album, Heaven Is for Easy Girls, on Mint Records in 2006. Nelkin performed much of the music himself, with some help from violinist Kim Koch and trumpeter Shaun Brodie. The album charted on Canadian campus radio and CBC Radio 3, which named the band's song \"We're Going for a Ride\" one of its Top 94 songs of 2006.\n",
      "With Tygh Runyan, Tony Koelwyn and Chris Mitchell, The Awkward Stage released a second album, Slimming Mirrors, Flattering Lights, in 2008.  The songs were written and arranged by Nelkin.\n"
