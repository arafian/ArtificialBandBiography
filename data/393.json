      "4-4-1 (also written as \"441\") are an alternative-pop Christian rock band who played primarily in the 1980s.  4-4-1 consisted of lead singer/guitarist John McNamara, drummer Steve Giali, lead guitarist John Giali and bassist/keyboardist Glenn Holland.\n",
      "Formed in 1983, 4-4-1 discovered their blend of catchy beats and melodies capped with insightful lyrics in Glenn's parents’ garage in Arcadia, California, the hometown of all four members.\n",
      "The band recorded their first demo tape of four songs (Judgment Game, Love's Irony, Mom & Dad and Break Out) in the garage and sent it to youth pastors around southern California.  Randy Ziegler, who ran the very popular concert series at Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa, responded with enthusiasm and immediately met with the band and set in motion high-profile concerts as well as discussions with record labels.\n"
