      "The Nymphs are an American alternative rock band that performed in the late 1980s and early 1990s with lead singer Inger Lorre. The band was signed to Geffen Records, and released their debut album in 1991. The Nymphs are known for their wild stage shows and their rebellious attitude towards record companies. The band formed in 1985 and broke up in 1992, formed again in 2016, and broke up the same year, later reforming in 2017.\n",
      "Lorre and Bobby Belltower formed the band in New Jersey in the mid 1980s. The band moved to Los Angeles to pursue their musical careers, and after two members returned to New Jersey, Lorre and Siegel recruited guitarist Sam Merrick, drummer Alex Kirst and bass player Cliff D. (Cliff Jones).\n",
      "The band was hoping to sign with an alternative label such as Alternative Tentacles, but their reputation led to interest from the major labels. However, the band's wild behavior led to some companies losing interest.\n"
