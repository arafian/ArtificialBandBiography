         "Papa Wheelie is an American punk rock/heavy metal band, formed in 1996 by former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted.\n",
         "The band emerged from a mountain biking-based friendship between Jason and his neighborhood bike shop owner. Early in the project, Newsted played the drums and fellow Michigan-native Steven Wiig played the guitar.  Since then, Newsted assumed full guitar and vocal responsibilities while Wiig returned to the drumkit and handled artistic duties.\n",
         "The band records every single session at Newsted's home studio, The Chophouse, and have played several Bay Area gigs - ranging from outdoor BBQs to his neighbor's living room birthday party to local San Francisco rock clubs.\n",
         "The band was in an idle state due to Newsted's shoulder injuries, but was resurrected in August 2011 after Newsted & Wiig simultaneously viewed the U.S. Desert episode of Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations featuring Kyuss, Queens Of The Stone Age and Desert Sessions founder Josh Homme, which inspired the resurrection of Papa Wheelie and resulted in the band performing several local Bay Area shows - including opening for Anvil at The Red Devil Lounge and Kyuss Lives! at San Francisco's Regency Ballroom on November 19, 2011, with The Sword & Black Cobra.\n"
