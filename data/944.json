      "The Brakes are a rock band formed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States in 2002.  The original five members were Zach Djanikian, Matt Kass, Derek Feinberg, Josh Sack, and Adam Flicker.  In 2006, they performed at SXSW Showcase, as well as many festivals such as All Good, High Sierra and Wakarusa.  Their national touring has also enabled them to share the stage with artists such as Dave Matthews Band, O.A.R., Willie Nelson, John Fogerty, Live, and Widespread Panic.\n",
      "The band has had multiple EP releases, regular rotation on station WXPN in Philadelphia, and near capacity headliners at TLA.  In 2002, The Brakes set the record for highest ticket sales at The Point in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.\n",
      "In early 2006, The Brakes joined forces with H&R Block and became the face of the company's \"TaxCut program\" advertising campaign.  The advertisements were featured on major national networks during shows like American Idol and The OC.   The \"TaxCut Program\"'s print campaign graced the back covers of Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone, and Us Weekly.\n"
