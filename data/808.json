         "Studio was a Swedish electronic music band. They have been described as the missing link between The Cure and Lindstrøm - while simultaneously touching upon Can, Neu, Happy Mondays and The Smiths -  in their creation of an \"afrobeat-dub-disco-indie-pop\" adventure. Their album West Coast was chosen by Rough Trade in London as one of the 10 best albums of 2007 and they have remixed artists such as Kylie Minogue and A Mountain of One.\n"
