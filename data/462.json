      "Mad at the World is a Christian rock band from Southern California. The band originally consisted of brothers Roger Rose and Randy Rose and their friend Mike Pendleton, later joined by Brent Gordon. Pendleton and Gordon left the band in 1992 and were replaced by Mike Link and Ben Jacobs. The band produced seven studio albums, one compilation package and two double reissues of previous albums.\n",
      "Roger Rose was a mail carrier in southern California when he formed the band in 1987. The job gave him a chance to work out songs in his head, writing ideas down when he got back to his Jeep. He also already owned a lot of synthesizers, drum machines and recording equipment. One day while on his route, he stuck a tape in a Frontline Records executive's mailbox.\n",
      "When asked to explain the name of the band, Roger cites 1 John 2:16, \"love not the world, neither the things of the world.\"\n"
