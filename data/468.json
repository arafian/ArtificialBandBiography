         "Dan Muckala was a musical composition student at Belmont University in Tennessee.[1] \nIn 1996, he became a professional songwriter and penned a number of Top Ten songs on contemporary hit radio.[1] Prior to forming the band, Muckala had also toured with other artists and led worship for a youth group.[2] \nAccording to Muckala, \"the band got started out of a desire that God gave me to put together a group that . . . really was focused on reaching kids and not just playing music either. I've always felt that Christian music should be a medium that reaches into the mainstream.\"[3] \nSigned in early 1998 to Essential Records,[4] \nMukala released their debut album, Fiction, in September.[5] \nThe band's musical style drew comparisons to Silage, Smash Mouth, and Beck.[4][5] \nTheir first single, \"Soap\", received airplay on Christian rock and Top 40 radio stations.[2] \nIn an industry first, the single \"Regret\" was released as an Internet download.[4] \n\"Regret\" was also featured on the soundtrack of the 1999 movie Drive Me Crazy, starring Melissa Joan Hart and Adrian Grenier. Since the album's release, Dan Muckala became a record producer.[6]\n"
