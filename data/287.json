   "rawData": [
      "Bend Sinister is a progressive-indie band formed in 2001 now based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The band takes its name from a novel by Vladimir Nabokov.\n",
      "The band formed in 2001 and began playing as many bar shows as they possibly could in their home town of Kelowna, British Columbia. After their move to Vancouver BC, selling out a four-song EP, and acquiring a new drummer and guitarist, the band sought out local producer Shawn Cole to put together what is now their first full-length album Through the Broken City. The band did three consecutive nationwide tours in support of the album.\n",
      "After gaining experience from the road, Bend Sinister returned to the studio to record a few new songs. These songs included the single \"Time Breaks Down\", which moved the band into uncharted territory and captured the attention of Distort Entertainment president, Greg Below.\n"
